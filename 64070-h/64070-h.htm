<span class="cheaderfont">A DISCOVERY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Near the mouth of Spuyten Duyvil Creek the yacht <em>Day
Dream</em> lay at anchor on a certain day in September, two
years ago.</p>

<p>The driving rain only served to give her white hull,
with its trimmings of gold, an additional luster, bringing
into yet bolder relief the polished mahogany and
walnut inboard woodwork.</p>

<p>Two sailors and an old colored steward remained below
to escape an unnecessary wetting, and the fifty-ton
beauty tugged at the cable as if trying to escape from her
moorings before her caretakers should be aware of the
fact.</p>

<p>On the river bank, half-hidden by a clump of trees, was
the old stone house owned by Henry Mansfield, formerly
a captain in the China trade, but now retired. Having
accumulated considerable wealth, he believed it would be
more pleasant to remain ashore permanently; but, after
a short time of idleness, his love for the sea returned with
redoubled force, and, as a result, the <em>Day Dream</em> was purchased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>On her the captain spent considerably more than half
his time, and now the little craft was provisioned for a
long southern cruise, much to the delight of the owner’s
son Gilbert, and his nephew, Nelson Duncan, who had,
after no slight difficulty, succeeded in gaining permission
to make the voyage.</p>

<p>The boys were on shore overhauling their traps, preparatory
to leaving early next morning, and having considerable
trouble in deciding just what should be left behind.</p>

<p>“We’ve laid out a big pile of stuff,” Gilbert said, as he
surveyed the guns, fishing tackle, clothes, and a general
assortment of odds and ends, which both he and his
cousin had thought would be necessary to their comfort
and pleasure during the voyage; “but if we throw anything
out, it will be just what we may want most when
the yacht is at sea.”</p>

<p>“But how are we to get so much aboard?”</p>

<p>“In case your trunk and mine won’t hold it all, there’s
an old chest in the attic, which will be the very ticket.
If it doesn’t stop raining pretty soon, we’ll have to get a
piece of tarpaulin to cover them while going out to the
schooner.”</p>

<p>That the old chest would be needed was learned very
soon, and Gil said, with a sigh:</p>

<p>“There’s no question but that something must be left.
We’ll pack the most important, and then decide as to the
rest. Come on, it won’t take long to overhaul what is in
the attic.”</p>

<p>The only idea in the minds of the boys was to secure<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
that which would serve as a receptacle for their goods
until the same could be carried to the schooner, and, on
finding the well-worn chest, it was only natural to first
make sure that it was empty.</p>

<p>The rusted lock was fastened, and, eager to complete
the work as soon as possible, Gil knocked the hasp off by
kicking at it, after which the lid was thrown open.</p>

<p>At first glance one would have said that it contained
nothing, but on turning it upside down several articles
rolled out.</p>

<p>Idle curiosity, rather than a belief that anything important
would be found, caused the boys to pick up the
contents, and Nelse cried, as he went toward the window:</p>

<p>“Say, Gil, here’s a piece of an old newspaper, containing
what appears to be an old story. Where did the
chest come from?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Read what you have found, if it is
interesting.”</p>

<p>“There is a long account here, but if you can keep
quiet a few moments, I’ll make it out, in spite of the many
creases and the dirt.”</p>

<p>Then Nelse began the following:</p>

<p>“North of that wild promontory which projects itself
into the tropic waters of the Mexican Gulf at the northwestern
extremity of Hayti, and four miles to seaward of
the ancient town, lies a rocky inlet known as Tortuga de
Mar. In size and aspect it is insignificant. Yet, lilliputian
and unfamiliar though it now is, it gave birth to the
most merciless and picturesque class of marine cutthroats
known to history.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>“Keep that until we start,” Gil said, impatiently, as his
cousin paused to take a long breath. “Just now we want
to get our traps aboard, instead of reading some musty
tale.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, and find out what it means. We’ve
got plenty of time,” Nelse said, and then he continued:</p>

<p>“Back in the opening decades of the seventeenth century
adventurous criminals from throughout the Antilles
began to collect on the islet, and in a few years Tortuga
became the recognized headquarters of the Spanish Main.
From it as from a fever germ went out a fire of blood,
piracy, and lawlessness which spread over the waters of
the Western World.</p>

<p>“Tortuga was settled in the first years of this century
by Spanish pioneers from the island known as Hispanola,
or ‘Little Spain.’ It was given the fanciful name of Tortuga
de Mar, ‘The Sea Tortoise,’ from its resemblance in
shape to that amphibian. The settlers were a worthy and
simple folk, for the most part fishermen, who, for a few
months in the twelve, varied life by hunting the wild
cattle which fed in the wooded coast lands.</p>

<p>“Scarcely had they become well established on the Tortoise,
when, one morning in May, 1632, they were mystified
at the sight of a pinnace load of strange seamen landing
on the key which faces the mouth of their harbor.
Fifteen restless spirits from the French colony of St.
Christopher had, with the adventurous recklessness which
marked that day and those waters, set out for the best
location which fortune and a west wind should put in
their way. They were allowed to put up sapodilla shelters<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
at the harbor mouth, and also to shoot their French
bullets into wild bulls on the opposite coast.</p>

<p>“In a few weeks it became evident that the rascally
strangers could slaughter and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boucan</i> more beeves in a
day than the entire Spanish community could in three.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boucanning</i>, by the way, was a peculiar process of curing
flesh by jerking, salting, and drying in the sunshine, the
term being derived from an aboriginal word applied by
the cannibal Caribbes to the curing of human flesh. Such
was the skill of the intruders in converting the bulls into
a superior, merchantable product by means of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boucan</i>
that the Spanish derisively applied the native word to
them.</p>

<p>“As Tortuga lay directly in the path of European vessels
bound for Mexican ports, the fifteen Frenchmen immediately
built up a thriving business in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boucanned</i> beef.
Doubloons, pieces-of-eight, and moidores became to them
as shells or seabeans to the Spanish fishermen. Word
went back apace to St. Christopher, throwing that island
into such an uproar that the craze to go <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a-boucanning</i>
carried its most unruly seamen to the Tortoise.</p>

<p>“Frenchmen came down upon the islet like a swarm of
mosquitoes, and overran it before the simple Spanish
folks could recover from their astonishment. Ominous
growlings were heard among the original settlers, but for
such trivial matters as round Spanish oaths the intruders
cared never a whit. Just before dawn, December 1, 1633,
the Spanish islanders met at the plaza of their little town,
and descended headlong upon the intruders at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boucanning</i><span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
beaches. Then began a massacre, during which
the intruders were cut down wherever found.</p>

<p>“Immediately after this the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boucanning</i> foreigners
formed themselves into a band composed of a collection
of couples. Each two hunters made common property
of all possessions of either. They bound themselves by
every oath to an imperishable brotherhood. Each swore
to avenge with death any insult offered to the other. The
two hunted and lived together by day, slept together by
night, and were as one flesh; and always as the band
ranged the coast valleys, grew the purpose of avenging
the Tortuga massacre.</p>

<p>“A few months later the Frenchmen took the islanders
by surprise. A carnival of butchery ensued. When it
was completed the village was burned. The most lawless
of the murderers was one Pierre Le Gros, a sailor of
oxlike frame and weight, hailing originally from Dieppe,
who, with twenty-seven fellow spirits, stole a small sloop
from a Tortugan skipper, and started on a nautical foray
on whatsoever Spanish merchantmen fate might cast in
his course.</p>

<p>“The act was of sufficient gravity to daunt even the
chosen crew of cutthroats captained by Pierre, had the
proposed prey been anything but Spanish, since it was
plain piracy. For two days the sloop ran on before a
northerly wind, swinging down into the Caribbean Sea,
but sighting no craft. On the third afternoon out Pierre
spied a galleon, one of the Panama pearl fleet, which had
been separated from its sister vessels in a recent hurricane.
Until night shut down, he craftily kept away toward<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
the windward horizon. Then, under cover of the
darkness, he swiftly and silently approached, coming
alongside at daybreak. The entire twenty-eight buccaneers
boarded the galleon, leaving their sloop adrift.</p>

<p>“Six men rushed headlong to the gunroom, taking immediate
possession. Six more went to the clumsy steering
apparatus, while Pierre, with the remaining fifteen,
hove the morning watch overboard and made for the
cabin. On bursting into the captain’s room, Pierre found
the worthy Don playing at cards with his officers, and discussing
a goodly measure of Madeira.</p>

<p>“Before the captain could speak, the pirates swarmed
into the apartment, and covered the group with their pistols.
In less than three minutes the prize was theirs.
The crew were marooned, and the galleon taken to
France, where, she and her cargo quickly disposed of, the
buccaneers left with all speed to rendezvous at the
Tortuga.</p>

<p>“When the intelligence of this exploit reached the Tortoise,
the entire island was thrown into a hubbub. Nothing
was thought of but to go buccaneering for galleons.
Brig after brig and ship after ship were fitted out, and in
a year this species of piracy became a recognized business.
Ten years later the Spanish commerce in these waters had
been almost entirely destroyed. The sea was forsaken
for the richer prizes on land. The rich capital of Campeche
was sacked, to be, in turn, followed by Panama, and
the curers of beef had become such a power as to attract
the attention of every nation.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” Gil asked, as Nelse ceased reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>“Every word, and it isn’t such a bad sort of story,
except that there’s not more than half enough. I wonder
why your father has been keeping it in the chest?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he knew it was here. But look at the
rest of this stuff! Do you suppose these have anything
to do with the piece of newspaper?”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Gil picked up the other articles, and he
and Nelse were gazing at them in perplexity when Captain
Mansfield entered the attic.</p>

<p>“Well, what are you boys hunting for? Pirates’ gold?”
Captain Mansfield asked, with a hearty laugh, as he
looked over Gil’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“We came here for this old chest, because our trunks
won’t hold all we want to carry, and in it found these
things, which I don’t suppose amount to anything; but I
can’t make out why you or any one else would want to
keep them.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Gil laid on the lid of the box the different,
apparently useless, articles which had fallen out when the
hasp was broken. They all had that peculiar musty,
salty odor, which tells of months spent in the forecastle,
while the good ship plows her way across this or that
ocean, one day aided by favoring winds, and on the next
battling for life with the spirit of the tempest.</p>

<p>First the newspaper story was placed before Captain
Mansfield; then a small coil of thin, well-waxed cord;
then a piece of hard, dark-colored wood about four inches
long by two wide, with the following marks rudely cut,
as if with a sheathknife:</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>A fragment of an old British admiralty chart, showing
a portion of the northwestern end of the Island of Hayti,
was next examined, and then Gil unfolded a rough drawing,
of which the sketch below is an exact copy:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i016.jpg" alt="Old British admiralty chart." />
</div>

<p>“Do you know where these things came from?” Gil
asked, after his father had gazed at the odd collection for
several moments in silence.</p>

<p>“I never saw them before.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t this your chest?”</p>

<p>Captain Mansfield examined the outside of the box intently,
apparently more interested in the find than the
boys, and then said, slowly:</p>

<p>“It belonged to an old sailor whom I found in Hong
Kong many years ago. He was in the last stages of consumption,
and begged me to bring him to this country. I
advised him to remain in the hospital, for it seemed certain
he would die at sea; but he persisted, and on the
fortieth day out we were obliged to give him a sailor’s
burial. The night he died we were doing our best to
save the ship, she having been partially dismasted in a<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
typhoon, and when he asked for me, I was needed on
deck. He sent word by one of the men that I was to
keep his chest, which I did, although it seemed nothing
more than a dying man’s whim. It was probably brought
here with my dunnage, and I have never thought of it
since. Now I can fancy what sort of a yarn he wanted
to tell me.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose these things refer to buried treasure?”
Nelse asked, excitedly, remembering what had been read.</p>

<p>“He probably thought he knew where some of the
buccaneers had hidden their booty. Take ten old sailors
together, and it is safe to say that five of them believe
they can find gold which has been hidden by pirates.”</p>

<p>“Is what we read in the newspaper true?” Gil asked.</p>

<p>“There can be no question about it. There have been
several reliable histories of these sea robbers written, and
by looking in an encyclopædia you will learn how fragmentary
this article is. New Segovia, in Honduras, was
sacked by them. Maracaibo and Gibraltar, in the Gulf
of Venezuela, were plundered by the buccaneers under
the command of D’Ollonois. Morgan, with two thousand
men, crossed the Isthmus to lay siege to Panama, and destroyed
it. Coxon ravaged the coast of Peru, and I might
go on telling of their crimes until next week without finishing
the story. All this doesn’t prove, however, that
your find contains a clew to buried gold.”</p>

<p>“But why not try to learn if these things really amount
to anything?” Gil suggested, eagerly. “You have said
you didn’t care where we went, and this would give us a
purpose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and one involving no end of hard work; but if
you boys want to make the venture, and can decide where
this particular spot is located, I’ll head the <em>Day Dream</em>
for the place, and give you a chance.”</p>

<p>Nelse and Gil began to express their gratification; but
the latter’s father interrupted them by saying:</p>

<p>“Don’t thank me. Treasure hunting is very different
from what you fancy, and one day’s work, under a tropical
sun, no matter how promising your clews may be,
will result in a most intense desire to leave such jobs to
other idiots. It is time now to get your traps on board,
for the storm gives promise of clearing away, with a
favoring wind, and the <em>Day Dream</em> will be under way before
sunrise.”</p>

<p>Then Captain Mansfield left them, and the boys set
about obeying his orders by first wrapping the supposed
guides to a large amount of wealth carefully in brown
paper, after which the remainder of the work was quickly
accomplished, for their minds were so filled by belief in
their ability to unearth a pirate’s hoard, that many things
were left behind, which, under less exciting circumstances,
would have been thought absolutely indispensable.</p>

<p>An hour later the two were sitting in a snug corner of
the yacht’s kitchen, talking with the old darky who was
“de captin ob dis yere place,” and who rejoiced in the
name of Andrew Jackson Washington Storts.</p>

<p>“De skipper am pow’ful fond ob loafin’ ’roun’ in de
schooner,” Andy said, by way of opening the conversation.</p>

<p>“But this time it’s to be a regular cruise,” Gil replied.<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
“We’re going for gold, and, unless a regular hurricane
strikes us, there’ll be no shortening of sail until we make
a harbor on the coast of Hayti.”</p>

<p>“Wha&mdash;wha&mdash;wha’s dat?” Andy asked, in mingled surprise
and alarm, and turned suddenly to face the boy.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing to be frightened about; we’re only going
to Hayti.”</p>

<p>“After pirates’ gold?”</p>

<p>“We shall make a try for it, although father don’t think
the venture will be success&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’ do it, honey, don’ do it. Yo’ neber was dar, an’
yer ain’ got any call fur to go.”</p>

<p>“You’ll think we’ve had a call when you see what was
found in the chest of a sailor who died aboard uncle’s
ship,” Nelse said, laughingly.</p>

<p>“You’se gwine kase ob wha’ a dead man tole yer?” and
now Andy exhibited every sign of fear.</p>

<p>“Of course a dead man couldn’t tell us anything,” Gil
replied, impatiently. “We don’t believe in ghosts.”</p>

<p>“But yer will, honey, ef dis yere craft anchors anywhere
’roun’ Hayti near the gold wha’s got blood on it.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve heard about treasure being buried there?”
Nelse cried, excitedly.</p>

<p>“I’se done more’n hear ’bout it, chile. Ef I should go
fur to tell yer all I’se seen, de berry hair would tumble
away frum yer head.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it, and we’ll risk our hair,” Gil said,
coaxingly.</p>

<p>“Yer doesn’t know wha’ you’se askin’, chile. I’d done<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
gone die dead ef I should splain half I’se seen in dat hole
ob de debble. Does yer hab any idee who’s libbin’ dere?”</p>

<p>“The natives of the island, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Jes’ listen to me, chillun, an’ den go ashore same’s
I’se gwine fur to do ef de captain ’sists on headin’ dis yere
schooner to dat place. Dere’s voudoos ’roun’ de coast,”
and the old man looked over his shoulder, as he spoke, as
if believing some horrible punishment would be meted
out to him for so much as mentioning the dreaded name.</p>

<p>“What are they?” Nelse asked, surprised at the exhibition
of fear.</p>

<p>Andy looked at the questioner as if in pity because of
the ignorance displayed, and after a short, impressive
pause, replied, solemnly:</p>

<p>“Ef yer doesn’ know, honey, Andy Storts ain’ de one
wha’s gwine fur to put yer in any trubble. Dem as goes
to dat ar place ain’ nebber gwine ter cum back, an’ yer
better foller me ashore, kase I don’ hanker arter bein’
dead.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the old darky began gathering up such
of his belongings as were in the galley, literally trembling
with fear meanwhile, and the boys regarded each
other in silent amazement until the trampling of feet overhead
caused Gil to dart up the narrow companionway.</p>

<p>An instant later he shouted:</p>

<p>“Come here, Nelse! The storm has cleared off, and
we are under way.”</p>

<p>An exclamation of dismay burst from Andy’s lips, and,
dropping the articles from his arms, <a id="B_18" href="#Ref_18">he rushed to the
deck</a>.</p>

<div id="Ref_18" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i049.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“Andy rushed to the deck.” <a href="#B_18">See page 18</a>.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>The <em>Day Dream</em> was already several miles from her
anchorage, sending the spray up from her glistening cut-water
as she glided swiftly, with every inch of canvas
drawing, toward the sea.</p>

<p>The exhilaration of the sail caused the boys to forget
Andy and his fears temporarily, and they watched the
graceful craft threading her way in and out among the
many vessels and steamers, now apparently about to be
run down by some iron monster, and again threatening a
saucy tug with a blow of her fore foot.</p>

<p>Captain Mansfield was standing near the helmsman,
watching over the safety of his yacht, when the old darky
approached him in the highest state of excitement.</p>

<p>“I’se done gone altered up my mind, captin, an’ carn’
go on dis yere cruise,” Andy cried, forgetting, in his
terror, that he had no right to speak to the master of the
schooner under such circumstances.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue and go back to the galley! I’ll
listen to you when we are outside.”</p>

<p>“I’se gwine ter be set ashore, sah.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to be thrown overboard, if you don’t
stop that noise and get away from here,” was the stern
reply, and, fearing present danger rather than that in the
future, the steward beat an undignified retreat, but at the
same time firmly resolved he would not allow himself to
be carried to sea in the <em>Day Dream</em>.</p>

<p>Gil and Nelse had heard the short conversation; but
there were so many things to occupy their attention, that
they dismissed it for the time being, as something too
trivial to require a second thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>And each moment the <em>Day Dream</em> was drawing nearer
and nearer to the entrance of the harbor. The wind was
favoring, and Captain Mansfield, true to the instincts
which had animated him while in command of a ship,
thought only of showing his celerity in leaving port.</p>

<p>Down through the narrows the little craft speeded,
leaving behind a wake of silver to show her course, and
from there to the lower bay, still holding the wind at its
best drawing point, until she was finally bowing and
courtesying to the long swell of the Atlantic, while in the
galley old Andy remained on his bended knees, praying
that stress of weather might force her into some port before
reaching Hayti, at which he could make his escape
from the terrible dangers which he firmly believed threatened
all who should attempt to recover the buried treasure
which had been gained only by the shedding of blood.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A MESSAGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It is not to be supposed that the boys escaped a severe
attack of seasickness when the <em>Day Dream</em> was tossing
about on the Atlantic swell.</p>

<p>Both had indulged in a certain amount of yachting in
the river and sound; but the violent leaps and plunges of
the schooner were something so entirely different from
what they had been accustomed to, that all power of resistance
was lost immediately giddiness and nausea seized
their victims.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that the first two days out were not
particularly enjoyed by the boys; but, at the expiration of
that time, even the suggestion of fried salt pork failed to
disturb them, and once more they were in a condition to
speculate upon the possibility of finding a buried treasure.</p>

<p>That old Andy had not succeeded in going ashore they
knew, because of having seen him several times; but his
fears had not been allayed, as could be told by the expression
on his face. He had the appearance of one who
fancies he is menaced by a sudden and immediate danger,
and glanced from time to time over his shoulder,
looking, as Nelse expressed it, “as if he believed half-a-dozen
pirates were trying to sneak up on him.”</p>

<p>Half-an-hour after their first appearance on deck since<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
the yacht left Sandy Hook, the boys paid the cook a visit,
and hardly were they inside the galley when he broached
the subject uppermost in his mind by asking:</p>

<p>“Has you’se done gone tole de captin ’bout wha’s gwine
ter happen ef dis yere schooner fools ’roun’ de shore ob
Hayti?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t done much of anything else than attend to
our stomachs for the last two days, Andy,” Gil replied,
with a laugh. “Why don’t you speak to him about it?”</p>

<p>“I’se had ernough ob dat kin’ ob work. De night we
done lef’ port I tole him as how dis nigger wouldn’t stay
aboard, an’ by jes’ de po’est kin’ ob luck dere was a rope’s
end handy fur him to grab.”</p>

<p>Andy rubbed his back, thus preventing any necessity
for further disclosures, and the boys laughed heartily,
thereby causing the old man to lose his temper.</p>

<p>“Dere ain’ no fun in dem tings, an’ de captin’s gwine
ter fin’ out de se’rus side ob life ef he keeps dis yere craf’
headed like she am now.”</p>

<p>“It’s foolish for you to trouble your head about what
we may find in Hayti,” Nelse replied, earnestly, “for even
in case we should touch at the very spot where these voudoos
hang out, you needn’t go ashore.”</p>

<p>“Dey kin cum at yer anywhere,” Andy said, with an
ominous shake of the head, and then he turned so suddenly,
in order to look over his shoulder, lest the phantoms
of the pirates should be pursuing him, that he nearly
toppled headlong.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, the boys enjoyed this hugely,
and their mirth only served to kindle his wrath anew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>He closed his thick lips tightly, as if to say he would
not allow himself to be coaxed into speaking again, and
Gil was on the point of trying to soothe him, when a
shout from above caused him to remain silent.</p>

<p>“The captain says the boys are to come on deck and
see what we have picked up.”</p>

<p>Gil and Nelse obeyed hurriedly, and were not a little
surprised at seeing nothing more than a dead bird lying
on the main hatch.</p>

<p>“Did you shoot it?” Gil cried, in surprise, wondering
how it happened that they had not heard the report of
firearms.</p>

<p>“It was dead, floating, and we picked it up,” Captain
Mansfield replied.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“I saw something red had been tied under the poor
thing’s wing, and wanted to find out what it meant. By
doing so, we shall be able to rescue several unfortunate
men from considerable suffering, if not death.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Gil asked, in astonishment, and
in reply his father held up a small piece of brown paper.</p>

<p>“This was what we found wrapped in a tarred cloth,
with a bit of red flannel to attract attention. The cord
was a piece of gut, which has swelled until the messenger
choked to death.”</p>

<p>Gil took the paper almost reverentially, and, as Nelse
looked over his shoulder, read the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Shipwrecked men on Walker Key at the northern slope of
Little Bahama Banks, dying from thirst.</p></div>

<p>This message from the sea, brought by a bird, and discovered<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
only by the merest chance, caused the boys the
most intense astonishment, and Gil asked, breathlessly:</p>

<p>“Do you believe it can be true, father?”</p>

<p>“People do not do such things for sport. It must have
cost them considerable labor and ingenuity to catch this
gull, and if they are yet alive, we’ll soon relieve their
sufferings.”</p>

<p>“Are you heading for there now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it is very nearly a true course for us. We
had only to shift the helm a couple of points.”</p>

<p>“When shall we arrive?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow noon, if this wind holds. Go into the
cabin, and by looking at the chart which is spread out on
the table, you will learn exactly where the sufferers were
when this gull was set free.”</p>

<p>The boys went below, after looking once more at the
bird which had performed its mission, even in death, and
then it was not difficult to ascertain very nearly the position
of the schooner, for the course had been traced in
pencil on the chart up to that morning.</p>

<p>“We can’t be delayed very long,” Gil said, after they
had gratified their curiosity, “for if the men are yet alive
they’ll be ready to leave the key at a moment’s notice;
but I suppose it will be necessary to put them ashore somewhere
before we go to Hayti.”</p>

<p>“You are talking as if we knew exactly where to find
the place marked out on the paper we found.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t we?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to say that I do.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem as if there could be any question about<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
it. The piece of newspaper referred to what had taken
place on the Tortuga de Mar, and the fragment of chart
showed that island&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a portion of Hayti as well.”</p>

<p>“But the drawing represents a small body of land.”</p>

<p>“Look at it again, and you’ll see that only a part has
been shown. How do you know it does not represent the
end of some other key?”</p>

<p>“The newspaper shows that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” Nelse replied, firmly. “What we
read was the story of how buccaneering first came about,
and, of course, it was necessary to speak of the small key
where it had its birth.”</p>

<p>“If that was its only use, why did the owner of the
things we found keep it so carefully?”</p>

<p>“Probably to show his shipmates that at least a portion
of his story was true.”</p>

<p>Until this moment Gil had had but little time to speculate
upon the supposed treasure, owing to the fact of his
having been taken sick so soon after the discovery in the
attic was made, and now a very unpleasant doubt came
into his mind.</p>

<p>It no longer seemed such an easy matter to find the
place designated, and he began to fear the treasure hunting
would be brought to an end before it had really commenced.</p>

<p>“I shall believe the Tortuga de Mar is the place until
we have searched over it pretty well,” Gil said, after a
long pause. “Then, if nothing is found, we’ll say the
drawing must refer to some spot on the island of Hayti.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>“But what about the voudoos which are causing Andy
so much alarm?”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” a voice asked from the companionway,
and an instant later Captain Mansfield was in the cabin.
“Where did you boys ever hear anything about voudoos?”</p>

<p>“Andy says they’ll kill us if we attempt so much as to
anchor near where any pirate hoard is supposed to be
hidden,” Gil replied, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“So that is why he insists on being put ashore?” the
captain said, half to himself.</p>

<p>“Is there any real reason why he should be afraid?”
Nelse asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. It is true that there are a large number
of negroes, more especially in Hayti, who believe in
that sort of mummery; but you can hunt for the treasure
just as long as you please without fear of being molested
by any of them.”</p>

<p>“And you are willing we should make the attempt?”</p>

<p>“Dig away as much as you please; but I fancy a couple
of days’ work will give you all the searching that’s
needed.”</p>

<p>“Will you help us find the spot as shown by the
drawing?”</p>

<p>“I’ll spend a short time at it, providing we have safe
anchorage for the schooner.”</p>

<p>This was even more than Gil had dared to hope, and
his spirits revived wonderfully.</p>

<p>“Then we shan’t have any trouble in bringing away a
lot of gold,” he cried, and from that moment until it was<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
time to retire, save when they were eating, he and Nelse
studied the tracing on the piece of brown paper.</p>

<p>When the boys “turned in,” the wind was blowing
steadily from the same quarter as when the message from
the shipwrecked ones was received, and there appeared to
be no doubt but that the <em>Day Dream</em> would make the key
at the time set by Captain Mansfield.</p>

<p>Even the idea of the treasure did not prevent the boys
from thinking very much of the sufferers, whom they
hoped to be able to relieve, and on awakening next morning,
the first question was as to whether the necessary
rate of speed had been maintained.</p>

<p>“We’ll be there on time,” Captain Mansfield replied,
cheerily. “Before twelve o’clock we shall have performed
a good deed at the expense of but little trouble,
or have the satisfaction of knowing we did all that was
possible, under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>Old Andy seemed to have resolved that he would find
cause for fear in everything which happened.</p>

<p>“We’se gwine straight to de debble,” he grumbled,
when the boys spoke with him about the shipwrecked
men. “Dere’s no use ter try an make me tink a bird
knowed enuf after he was dead, to float alongside dis yere
schooner so’s we could get de writin’, kase it don’ stan’ to
reason.”</p>

<p>“That part of it was chance, of course,” Gil replied,
“and I can’t see that there is anything strange in the men
doing all they could to attract attention.”</p>

<p>“Wha’ men?”</p>

<p>“Those who have been shipwrecked.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>“Dere’s sumfin wrong ’bout de whole bizness, kase
where’s de sailor man what kin ketch a gull? I’se tellin’
you, honey, dat de voudoos hab foun’ out whar we was
gwine, an’ am beginnin’ to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He did not have an opportunity to finish the sentence,
for at this point the boys literally roared with laughter,
and he turned away indignantly, refusing to speak again
until some one from the deck shouted:</p>

<p>“The key is in sight. If you boys want to get the first
glimpse of the shipwrecked sailors, it is time you were
tumbling up here.”</p>

</div>


<p>Gil and Nelse, who had expected to see an island of
fair proportions, were considerably disappointed on reaching
the deck at the scene before them.</p>

<p>A long, low stretch of sand, hardly rising above the
level of the ocean, could be distinguished directly ahead,
and was about as uninviting a place as one could find.
Toward the eastward the surf broke with considerable
violence, and this it was, rather than the key itself, which
attracted attention to the spot.</p>

<p>Already preparations were being made to lower one of
the boats, and Gil asked his father:</p>

<p>“How near can we go to land?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t safe to venture very far across. It is all shoal
water to the westward of us, and I shall hold the schooner
off about a mile.”</p>

<p>“Do you see any signs of them?”</p>

<p>“The smoke is enough to show they’re keeping a pretty
sharp lookout,” and Captain Mansfield pointed to a thin
thread of blue, which had been unnoticed by the boys
until this moment. “That is a signal which they started
the moment we hove in sight; but it’s dying down, now
we’ve shown our intention of running toward them.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the boys could distinguish, by aid of<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
the glass, a number of figures on the beach, and Nelse
said, with a laugh:</p>

<p>“Andy will be more certain than ever that the voudoos
have had a hand in this business when he finds out how
many extra men he is obliged to cook for. It looks to
me as if there were at least a dozen.”</p>

<p>“Fully as many as that,” Captain Mansfield added,
“and we shall be crowded uncomfortably for a while; but,
fortunately, Nassau isn’t so far away that we need worry
very much about lack of room.”</p>

<p>At this moment the old darkey came on deck, and Gil
shouted:</p>

<p>“There’s a whole crowd of them! The voudoos have
sent us lots of company.”</p>

<p>Andy looked from the captain to the key in a sort of
bewilderment, and one of the sailors, who stood near him,
said:</p>

<p>“You’ll have your hands full now, cookee, for we’re
likely to add twelve or fifteen to this schooner’s crew.”
Andy raised his arms above his head, as if in despair,
and then turning suddenly, ran below to the galley, from
which place he did not emerge again until it was time to
serve dinner.</p>

<p>The schooner was hove to, when it seemed to the boys
as if she was a very long distance to the eastward of the
key; but, as a matter of fact, she was on the edge of the
bank, and as near in shore as it was safe to venture.</p>

<p>One of the small boats was lowered, and two sailors
rowed toward the shore.</p>

<p>The mate of the yacht&mdash;Job Jenkins, a young man not<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
more than twenty-five years of age&mdash;was leaning over
the rail near where Gil and Nelse stood, and after watching
the men as they pulled the tender around to the western
shore of the key, to avoid the heavy breakers, he said,
petulantly:</p>

<p>“I ain’t a-sayin’ but what it’s our duty to take that
crowd off; yet it’s bound to use up the rest of this day,
and by sunset there won’t be so much as a breath of air
stirring.”</p>

<p>“Better a calm than a hurricane,” Gil replied, with a
smile.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that. The yacht can hold her own
under considerably more than a capful of wind, and I had
rather see her driving through the worst kind of a smother
than lying here with that mob on board.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Jenkins, can you make out any wreckage hereabouts?”
Captain Mansfield asked, lowering the glass
which he had been using.</p>

<p>“No, sir, and that is just what has been puzzling me.
I don’t understand how so many could have reached the
key without some kind of a craft, and if any vessel large
enough to carry such a crew had gone ashore within the
past three weeks, the hull should be held by the sand.”</p>

<p>“It has an odd look,” the captain replied, as he walked
farther aft to get a view from another point.</p>

<p>By this time the tender had gained the shore, and the
shipwrecked party, after quarreling among themselves,
made a rush for the boat.</p>

<p>“At least four trips will be necessary in order to get<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
them all on board,” Jenkins suggested, and Captain
Mansfield replied:</p>

<p>“Unless they are in a bad condition, which doesn’t appear
to be the case, let them do a portion of the work.
One man is enough to take the boat back, and the
strangers can pull out to us.”</p>

<p>Gil and Nelse watched eagerly as the first load approached
the yacht, and a scrutiny of the newcomers was
not at all favorable to them as good specimens of sailors.</p>

<p>They were a thoroughly disreputable-looking set, bearing
no evidences of hardship, and the boys fancied all
were more or less under the influence of liquor.</p>

<p>“Well,” Captain Mansfield said, as the first one, a
bushy-whiskered man, who appeared to be the leader,
came over the rail; “you don’t seem to be in as desperate
straits as I fancied would be the case when I found the
gull.”</p>

<p>“So you got the writin’, eh?” the man replied, with a
laugh. “I thought Johnson was wastin’ his time when he
laid ’round a couple of days tryin’ to catch the bird; but
it has turned out mighty lucky for us, after all.”</p>

<p>“<a id="B_32" href="#Ref_32">What vessel are you from?</a>”</p>

<div id="Ref_32" class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">“What vessel are you from?” <a href="#B_32">See page 32</a>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“The brig <em>Mary and Jane</em>, from Savannah for Nassau,
with an assorted cargo. There must have been a fire in
the hold when we left port, for we fought it from the
second day out until it got the best of us, and we had to
leave the old hooker.”</p>

<p>“Were you the captain?”</p>

<p>“Not much. He and the mates took the only boat that
would swim, and left us to shirk for ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that they deserted the crew?”
Captain Mansfield asked, watching the man sharply:</p>

<p>“That’s jest the size of it. My mates and I made shift
to get to the key, an’ there we’ve been ever since.”</p>

<p>It was some seconds before Gil’s father spoke again,
and the sailor shuffled about uneasily under his searching
gaze.</p>

<p>“You said you were without water.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t had a drop since we landed; but a couple
of casks of rum come ashore, an’ we’ve managed to get
along with that.”</p>

<p>“Did you scuttle the brig before leaving her?”</p>

<p>“There was no chance to do anything of the kind. We
kept her headed for the key till the fire got the best of
us, and she was in a light blaze when we saw her last.”</p>

<p>“How many are there of you?”</p>

<p>“Fourteen all told.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be snug stowing; but we’ll run for Nassau, and
land you as soon as possible,” and Captain Mansfield
turned as if to intimate that the interview was at an end.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to take deck passage, for there are only
four bunks in the forecastle, and they are all filled,” Mr.
Jenkins said, as he motioned the men forward.</p>

<p>“All right. Of course, we’re willin’ to stand our share
of the work,” the man replied, as he slouched along the
deck with a swaggering air.</p>

<p>“We’ve got crew enough, and in a small craft like this,
you would only be in the way.”</p>

<p>Then the mate gave orders that the sailors should return
with the boat, and the little craft was headed for the<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
shore once more, while the newcomers covertly examined
the yacht, as if they had a personal interest in her sea-going
qualities.</p>

<p>The captain appeared to be so disturbed in mind that
neither Gil nor Nelse ventured to ask him any questions
relative to the men whom he was taking off the key; the
boys stood amidships, where they could see all that was
going on, and as Captain Mansfield paced to and fro, only
stopping now and then to exchange a few words with Mr.
Jenkins, Nelse whispered:</p>

<p>“I don’t think your father is any too well pleased at
having so many people aboard.”</p>

<p>“I’m certain he isn’t, and can’t wonder at it. They are
a tough-looking set, and could make no end of trouble, if
they were so disposed.”</p>

<p>By this time the second load had come from the key,
and were no more prepossessing in appearance than the
first arrivals.</p>

<p>Captain Mansfield questioned them sharply, receiving
in substance the same replies as from the others, and
when the boat was headed for the shore again, he called
Mr. Jenkins to him.</p>

<p>Eager to know what was said, Gil motioned Nelse to
follow him, and the two went aft where the conversation
could be overheard.</p>

<p>“What do you think of the story they tell?” Captain
Mansfield asked his mate.</p>

<p>“It isn’t reasonable, and I believe it has been cooked up
for our especial benefit. That all the officers of a brig
should abandon the crew doesn’t sound reasonable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>“I am of the same opinion. They have either deserted
from their vessel, or mischief has been done.”</p>

<p>“In case it was nothing more than desertion, they would
have had a boat.”</p>

<p>“The same argument holds good under other and more
desperate circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Very true, sir.”</p>

<p>“We may never learn the truth; but we can take every
precaution against trouble. Keep your eyes open, Mr.
Jenkins, and don’t give them an opportunity to play us
any game.”</p>

<p>“I will see to it that they haven’t much rope aboard this
craft,” the mate replied, and then the conversation was
interrupted by Andy’s announcement that dinner was
ready.</p>

<p>The third boatload had not come off when the boys
went into the cabin, and there saw the old darky looking
thoroughly distressed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Gil asked, while they were waiting
for his father to come below.</p>

<p>“Say, honey, does you know how many ob dese yere
sailors am comin’ aboard?”</p>

<p>“Fourteen.”</p>

<p>“An’ am all ob dem gwine ter stay on de yacht?”</p>

<p>“There’s no other place for them until we can make
Nassau.”</p>

<p>“Den you hark to wha’ de ole man am tellin’ yer,” and
Andy looked cautiously around to make sure no one from
the deck could hear him. “Dis yere cruise am boun’ ter<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
end in trubble, an’ ef de captain keeps de yacht pinted for
Hayti, we’se nebber gwine ter git back.”</p>

<p>“Is this another case of the voudoos?” Nelse asked,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Now, don’ make fun ob wha’ de ole man tells yer,
honey, an’ ef dere’s a chance to ’swade de captin ter turn
’roun’ when we strikes Nassau, go fur him lively.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t likely father would put the schooner about,
simply because of what the voudoos might do, and if we
should say anything, it might only make matters worse.”</p>

<p>At this point Captain Mansfield came below, and Andy,
looking decidedly distressed, began to serve the meal.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">MISCHIEF.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. Jenkins’ predictions regarding the time necessary
to bring the castaways on board, and the weather, were
verified.</p>

<p>Not until nearly sunset did the little tender make the
last trip to the key, and by that time the calm was “raging.”
There was not air enough stirring to lift the
thread of blue at the truck, and the atmosphere had suddenly
grown so hot as to be almost stifling.</p>

<p>If Captain Mansfield had reason to distrust those whom
he was trying to aid, during the first interview, he had
good proof of their evil natures before the wind sprang
up again.</p>

<p>All the castaways were under the influence of liquor
to a greater or less degree, and those who came latest
must have contrived to bring an additional supply to their
companions.</p>

<p>Andy had prepared a substantial meal, which was
served on deck, and, instead of being grateful for the
same, there was more grumbling than might have been
expected from sailors whose only food for many days had
been “salt horse.”</p>

<p>The bushy-whiskered fellow, who acted as the leader
of the party was particularly aggressive, and, when<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
Andy had set out a well-cooked, generous amount of
corned beef, potatoes and cabbage&mdash;such a spread as they
would not have received anywhere, save on a pleasure
yacht&mdash;he asked, in a surly tone:</p>

<p>“Is this the kind of stuff you’re willin’ to put afore
shipwrecked men?”</p>

<p>“It’s de same as our own crew gets, an’ I ’lows as how
you’se kin make out ef yer berry hungry,” the cook replied,
angrily, turning to re-enter the galley.</p>

<p>“Don’t answer me back, you black villain, or I’ll break
every bone in your body!” and the man sprang to his feet
with a show of rage.</p>

<p>“I’se gwine ter say wha’ I wants ter,” Andy replied,
angrily. “I’se de cook ob dis yere craft, an’ ef yer
spectin’ ter git grub, dere ain’ no call fur yippin’.”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue!” the fellow cried, seizing his tin
plate of food and hurling it at the old darkey’s head.</p>

<p>Andy dodged the missiles, which, striking the companionway,
were scattered over the clean deck, and the
infuriated man ran toward him with the evident purpose
of inflicting bodily injury.</p>

<p>It so chanced that Captain Mansfield came from the
cabin at the same instant the plate was thrown, and, before
anything more could be done, he shouted:</p>

<p>“Hold on there! What is the meaning of all this?”</p>

<p>The words were sufficient to cause the man to halt suddenly,
and, turning around, he replied, in a sullen, insolent
tone:</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon on taking lip from any nigger, no matter
who he is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>

<p>The cook was still standing in the companionway, and
going forward quickly, the captain asked him what had
been said.</p>

<p>The sailor would have given his version of the affair,
attempting to prevent the old darky from speaking; but
Captain Mansfield said, sternly:</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, unless you want to be set ashore
again, and I’m not certain I should take the trouble of
using the boat.”</p>

<p>Andy gave a truthful account of all that had occurred,
and concluded by saying, as he pointed to the food on the
deck:</p>

<p>“Dere it be, capt’in, de same as I send to de cabin.”</p>

<p>By this time all the alleged shipwrecked men had laid
aside their plates to gather around the leader, standing
very near the captain in threatening attitudes, and, attracted
by the noise, Mr. Jenkins came on deck.</p>

<p>Captain Mansfield looked squarely in the fellow’s face
fully half-a-minute before he said:</p>

<p>“There is your supper. You will get no more to-night,
and you are either to eat or throw it overboard. In addition,
you will clean the deck at once.”</p>

<p>The man stood in an attitude of defiance, glancing now
and then at his companions, but making no move toward
obeying the orders; and Gil’s father, turning to the mate,
said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Jenkins, if my instructions have not been carried
out properly at the end of five minutes, throw this man
overboard. Call all hands, including the boys, if you need
assistance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p>Then the captain walked aft again, and the castaways
began whispering among themselves as if trying to decide
whether it would be safe to defy him.</p>

<p>Gil and Nelse stood near the wheel, where they could
hear and see everything. Both wanted to go forward,
but the former’s father checked them by saying, in a low
tone:</p>

<p>“Remain where you are, unless Mr. Jenkins should
call; in which case, you are to obey his orders implicitly.”</p>

<p>The mate was evidently making ready to carry out his
instructions. All the men, save the man who had thrown
the food, were sent back to the main hatch, and the young
sailor was looking at his watch in an ominous manner.</p>

<p>The castaway muttered something which the boys could
not understand; made a series of gestures to his companions,
but, without receiving any reply, and then in a
sulky manner began throwing the food overboard.</p>

<p>“Bring a swab here,” Mr. Jenkins called to one of the
crew, and the shipwrecked man used it vigorously until
the stains had been removed from the white planks.</p>

<p>“Now, where am I to get my supper?” the fellow asked,
sullenly.</p>

<p>“We don’t serve two meals at the same time on board
this craft, and, in case you want to be carried to Nassau,
I advise that you keep a civil tongue in your head, for
the captain is no fresh-water sailor, to allow an old barnacle
like you to back him down.”</p>

<p>Then the mate walked aft, and the rescued party began
to discuss the situation in whispers.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine crowd to ask honest sailors for assistance,”<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
Mr. Jenkins said, in a low tone, when he stood by
Captain Mansfield’s side. “If this calm lasts very long,
we are bound to have trouble with them.”</p>

<p>“Keep your weather eye lifting, and they can’t do much
mischief. They are all a little the worse for liquor now,
but when that wears off things will straighten out.”</p>

<p>“It would be serving the whole boiling lot right to set
’em ashore.”</p>

<p>“That would be inhuman, and, besides, neither you nor
I care to say that we’re afraid of a lot of sailors.”</p>

<p>“You would be warranted in trying to avoid trouble,
more especially when there are so many aboard.”</p>

<p>“We won’t discuss the matter any further, Mr. Jenkins.
Keep them well under your eye, and we’ll soon run
down this bank.”</p>

<p>Both Gil and Nelse understood that the captain, as well
as his mate, felt a trifle uneasy because of the strangers,
who outnumbered the available force of the yacht more
than two to one; but forcing them to return to the key
was not to be thought of for a single moment, and it only
remained for the officers to be on the alert.</p>

<p>Owing to the heat, and, possibly, because of the alleged
shipwrecked mariners, the boys found it impossible to
close their eyes in slumber at a very early hour on this
particular night.</p>

<p>Before retiring, Nelse had proposed that they pay Andy
a visit, but Gil objected on the score that it would only be
to hear his croaking relative to the visit to Hayti, and,
feeling decidedly disturbed in mind because of other reasons,
time spent in the galley promised but little pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>When the boys went below, the rescued party were
stretched out amidships, more comfortable there than they
would have been below, and, so far as could be judged by
their respective positions, intent only on seeking repose.</p>

<p>Two hours later, after Gil and Nelse had tossed and
turned in their bunks, unable to sleep because of the
almost stifling heat, the latter said:</p>

<p>“Let’s go on deck. There’s no chance we shall close
our eyes to-night if these mosquitoes continue so industrious,
and we may as well be where it is possible to get
the benefit of whatever air is stirring.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready to go, but we must move softly, in case
father happens to be asleep.”</p>

<p>Because of this caution, the two gained the deck in
nearly perfect silence, and the night was so dark that they
could not be seen by those who might be on watch, save
from a very short distance.</p>

<p>On the starboard side aft Mr. Jenkins was pacing to
and fro, the sound of his footsteps alone disturbing the
silence, and from the other side came a subdued murmur,
which told that the strangers were yet engaged in conversation.</p>

<p>Without knowing exactly why he did so, <a id="Ref_42" href="#B_42">Gil led his
cousin forward</a> until it was possible to distinguish what
the rescued men were talking about, and then that which
he heard was sufficient to attract his closest attention.</p>

<p>The bushy-whiskered fellow appeared to be the chief
speaker, and he said, just as the boys drew near:</p>

<p>“There are only five, counting the skipper and mate.
The cook and the cubs don’t amount to anything. This<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
yacht is a clipper, and, with her, we could soon find a
market for what has been left on the key.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we’ve done enough already?” a voice
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, if all hands have turned cowards. We shall not
get any deeper in the mud by taking what has come to us,
and, with a craft like this, everything is possible. I
wouldn’t want a better berth than to sail such a schooner
around the keys, stopping whenever we wanted two or
three days ashore, and going wherever we took a fancy.”</p>

<p>“You know what that means,” the same voice said.</p>

<p>“Supposin’ I do, haven’t we done the same thing already?
We can go ashore at Nassau, and then it may be
a good many months before we dare take what we’ve
earned. I’m for making the most of a good chance.”</p>

<p>“But how can it be fixed?”</p>

<p>“Come nearer an’ I’ll tell you; there’s no need of yelling
when there are so many to hear.”</p>

<p>The doubter moved across the deck, and Gil pressed
his companion’s arm in token that they should retire.</p>

<p>“There’s no need of listening to anything more,” Gil
said, when they were so near the wheel that there was no
danger the words would be overheard. “Those fellows
are plotting mutiny, and it is necessary father should
know it.”</p>

<p>“Why not speak with Mr. Jenkins?” Nelse whispered.</p>

<p>“Then we would be obliged to repeat the story twice.
Come below!”</p>

<p>Nelse followed without further remonstrance, and a
few moments later Captain Mansfield had learned sufficient<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
to convince him that his guests were not the most
honest people in the world.</p>

<p>“Are you certain no mistake has been made?” he asked,
when Gil concluded the narrative.</p>

<p>“We heard everything very distinctly, and I am positive
the words have been repeated correctly.”</p>

<p>“Call Mr. Jenkins, but do not let any one hear you,”
and Captain Mansfield sprang from his berth as Gil went
toward the companion-way.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">MUTINY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>To find the mate and tell him he was wanted in the
cabin did not occupy many moments, and the rescued
party, who had turned mutineers almost at the same moment
their appeal for help had been answered, apparently
paid no attention to the boy’s movements.</p>

<p>Captain Mansfield repeated to Mr. Jenkins what Gil
told him when the two were alone and the companion-hatch
drawn to prevent the possibility of the conversation
being overheard, and the expression which came over the
mate’s face showed how serious he believed was the situation.</p>

<p>“I am not surprised,” he said, thoughtfully. “After
the row with Andy, we had good reason to look for anything
in the way of rascality. What do you propose to
do?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know.”</p>

<p>“Although my opinion has not been asked, I should
say we had better set them ashore as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“To do that we would be precipitating the trouble, and,
besides, I hardly see how it can be done. When the first
boatload was landed, they might refuse to let the tender
be brought back, even in case they left the schooner willingly.
It is not going to be an easy matter to enforce<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
obedience while they so far outnumber us. What is the
look of the weather?”</p>

<p>“I think we shall have a fair sailing breeze by midnight.”</p>

<p>“Then it will be best to make an attempt to land them
at Nassau. Arm yourself, and we will both remain on
duty. At the first sign of insubordination use your
weapons promptly.”</p>

<p>It could be seen that Mr. Jenkins was not pleased with
this decision, but he was too good a sailor to find fault
with the commands of his superior officer.</p>

<p>He entered his cabin, reappeared a moment later with
bulging pockets, and went toward the companion-ladder,
stopping there only long enough to say:</p>

<p>“You will not be needed on deck, captain. I’ll answer
for that crowd until daylight.”</p>

<p>“It can do no harm to take excessive precautions, more
especially when they involve nothing more serious than
the loss of sleep. If you see the slightest sign of trouble,
call me.”</p>

<p>The mate went out into the gloom, and Captain Mansfield
said to the boys:</p>

<p>“There is no particular reason why you should be
frightened, but, at the same time, it is well to be prepared
for any emergency. Keep your revolvers where they can
be used at a moment’s notice, but do not make any move
toward using them without an express command from me
to that effect.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the men will attempt to seize the
schooner?” Gil asked, in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>“Not a bit of it; but yet almost anything is possible,
and that is why I want you to be prepared. If we get a
good sailing breeze at midnight, we shall be in Nassau
before those scoundrels can form a plan.”</p>

<p>Then the captain went on deck to have a look around,
and the boys discussed the question of “turning in.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it would be possible for me to close my
eyes while knowing those men are ready for mischief,
and there can be no mistake as to what we heard,” Nelse
said, in a whisper. “Why can’t we sit here in the cabin
all night?”</p>

<p>“Father wouldn’t like it, and, besides, if that crowd
should see us, they would know we had discovered their
secret.”</p>

<p>“Do you intend to lie down?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but there is no necessity of undressing, and, in
case anything does happen, we shall be ready to do our
share.”</p>

<p>Nelse would have preferred to remain on deck, but he
knew Captain Mansfield would not agree to such a plan,
therefore he followed his cousin to the tiny room which
adjoined the one occupied by Gil’s father.</p>

<p>However uneasy they might be regarding the intention
of the alleged shipwrecked crew, it was impossible to remain
awake very long after lying down, and in less than
half-an-hour the two were sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>They were still in the very heart of slumber-land at
midnight, when the looked-for breeze sprang up, and,
therefore, remained in ignorance of the fact that the
dainty white cloths of the yacht had been spread, causing<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
the beautiful little craft to heel coquettishly, as, with a
bone in her teeth, she darted over the black waters on a
true course for the Northeast Providence Channel.</p>

<p>“She is looking up into it well now,” Captain Mansfield
said, in a tone of satisfaction, as the <em>Day Dream</em> glided
across the waves, “and we can count on getting rid of our
passengers before another sun sets, for I believe this wind
will continue to freshen until morning, when we shall
have all she needs to induce her to show her best pace.”</p>

<p>The captain and his mate were standing well aft, with
a trusty man at the wheel, as the schooner gained headway,
and Mr. Jenkins replied, in a tone of relief:</p>

<p>“If your predictions are correct, sir, there’ll be little to
fear, for as yet this crowd are without any plan of action.
Why don’t you go below for a while?”</p>

<p>“I believe I will. Keep your wits about you, and don’t
hesitate to call me if anything looks wrong.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the captain went to his room, and in a
comparatively short space of time the sound of his heavy
breathing could be heard, even by the man at the wheel.</p>

<p>The mate paced to and fro more than an hour, and
then, fancying he heard a movement among the men, who
were supposed to be sleeping on deck, he went forward
to investigate.</p>

<p>The rescued party appeared to be wrapped in slumber,
as he made his way among the prostrate forms, and, blaming
himself for being unduly suspicious, Mr. Jenkins continued
on to the forecastle companion-way before turning
to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>The sailor who should have been on the lookout was<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
nowhere to be seen, and the mate stood for a moment expecting
him to come from below, when suddenly a hand
was clapped over his mouth, preventing him from uttering
the slightest sound.</p>

<p>At the same instant he was lifted bodily from his feet
and carried to the main hatch, where the mutineers had
no difficulty in binding and gagging him without any
more noise than might have been caused by one of the
men turning in his sleep.</p>

<p>Now that it was too late, Jenkins saw the missing
sailor lying close beside him, unable to move hand or foot,
and he understood that the castaways had formed a very
well-considered plan, which was already more than half
successful.</p>

<p>“It’s time now to tackle that fellow at the wheel,” the
leader of the party whispered. “I’ll lounge back there;
he’ll think I’m the mate until it is too late to make any
disturbance, and the minute I get him by the mouth you
must close in.”</p>

<p>“Why not call up the captain first?” one of the crowd
asked.</p>

<p>“Because then we should have two on hand at the same
time, and there’s no knowing what them boys might succeed
in doing. The easiest plan is the best, and so far
you’ve got no call to kick at the way I’ve managed this
business.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead; I won’t say another word until the
schooner is in our possession.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins struggled hard to make some noise, which
would serve to alarm the man at the wheel, but his bonds<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
and the gag had been tied too skillfully to admit of the
slightest movement, and he was forced to remain inactive
while the mutineers carried out their vile plot to the end.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes the helmsman was also a prisoner,
and one of the scoundrels took his station at the
wheel, but careful not to change the yacht’s course, in case
the captain should chance to be awake watching the tell-tale.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the leader of the mutineers, after
ordering his men to creep aft, where they would be hidden
from view by the deckhouse, entered the cabin and
knocked lightly on the owner’s door.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” the captain asked, awakening
at the first sound.</p>

<p>“Mr. Jenkins wants to know if you will come on deck
for a moment, sir,” was the whispered reply. “The wind
is freshening, and he would like to haul around more to
the westward.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer, the fellow went on
deck; but he stood close by the companion-way, after
whispering to the man at the wheel:</p>

<p>“Have that belaying-pin ready to knock him down, if
he doesn’t give me a fair chance of cutting off his wind.”</p>

<p>Then the sound of footsteps told that the captain had
left his room, and twenty seconds later he appeared at
the top of the ladder.</p>

<p>Coming suddenly into the darkness as he had, and unsuspicious
that the summons was a false one, the work of
making him a prisoner was exceedingly simple.</p>

<p>Struggle as he might, nothing could be effected, for<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
half-a-dozen of the scoundrels were upon him instantly
the leader made the first move, and now there was no
longer any necessity of preserving such perfect silence.</p>

<p>“Three of you tackle the cook, and when that has been
done, I’ll attend to the cubs,” the leader said, in an ordinary
tone, while Captain Mansfield was being carried to
the hatch and laid beside the mate and sailors.</p>

<p>“Its all done, and the nigger is lashed in his berth,”
one of the men reported before the prisoners thought sufficient
time had elapsed for the villains to reach the forecastle.</p>

<p>“Did he give you any trouble?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, but acted as if he expected something of the
kind. How long will it take you to fix the boys?”</p>

<p>“That part of it doesn’t amount to anything. Bring
some rope down, and I’ll end this business mighty quick.”</p>

<p>Nelse and Gil were sleeping soundly when the mutineers
opened the unlocked door. Beside them were the
revolvers, and these the ringleader took possession of, as
he said to his followers:</p>

<p>“Now truss ’em up; but there’s no need of using the
gags, for they can’t do any harm, no matter how loud they
yell.”</p>

<p>The first intimation the boys had that anything out of
the usual course had happened was when the men began
roughly to tie their hands and feet, and then only a single
glance was necessary to tell exactly what had been accomplished.</p>

<p>“Turn them out on deck, and we’ll make ourselves comfortable
here for a while before doing the rest of the<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
work,” the leader said, and, as if they had been so many
bundles of merchandise, Gil and Nelse were conveyed to
the main hatch, there to be flung roughly down.</p>

<p>From this time until fully an hour had passed the
mutineers paid no attention to their prisoners. Two men
were all that were needed on deck, and the others proceeded
to make free with the cabin stores, as could be
told by the sounds of revelry.</p>

<p>With sufficient wind to keep the canvas full and drawing,
the little yacht sped on over the long swells, while
her rightful crew could not so much as enjoy the poor
consolation of conversation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SET ADRIFT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The orgie in the cabin was continued until nearly daylight,
and during all that long, weary time the boys could
talk to, but not with, their companions.</p>

<p>They were the only ones who had been left ungagged,
and were free to discuss the matter, but without being
able to elicit a single answer.</p>

<p>“It isn’t hard to fancy how the whole thing has occurred,”
Gil said to Nelse; “but the question is, what do
they propose to do with us?”</p>

<p>“We shall find out mighty soon, I reckon, and the part
which has the most interest for us is whether they will cut
our throats or content themselves with simply making us
walk a plank, after the fashion of oldtime pirates. I
counted on finding the buccaneers’ treasure when we
started, but I didn’t suppose we should find the buccaneers
themselves.”</p>

<p>While the boys indulged in this rather mournful style
of conversation, the other prisoners writhed to and fro in
the vain effort to slip their bonds, and at each useless attempt
Gil would look around, wondering if it were not
possible to aid them in some way.</p>

<p>“Because we can speak, it seems as if we should be able
to do something,” he said, after his father had literally<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
exhausted his strength trying to get his hands free. “I’ve
read in stories of fellows who could chew ropes apart,
but I don’t know how to set about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s because such a thing isn’t possible,” Nelse replied,
very decidedly. “We can’t so much as move, and,
as for getting our heads where it would be possible to
bite at the bonds, it is simply out of the question. After
this I shall never believe in those yarns.”</p>

<p>“It might be done, if I could raise myself sufficiently to
get at the ropes.”</p>

<p>“That is a great, big ‘if’ under these circumstances, and
I shall put all those stories down as foolish lies after this
night.”</p>

<p>It was as if the desire to aid tired the boys, for before
this conversation had been continued half-an-hour both
were perspiring profusely, while they felt weary, although
having remained inactive.</p>

<p>It was a relief for all hands when the golden shafts of
light which came over the water proclaimed the rising of
the sun, and the revelers emerged from the cabin to complete
their act of piracy.</p>

<p>The leader lost no time in acquainting his prisoners
with the fate in store for them.</p>

<p>Coming toward the hatch with unsteady movements,
which told only too well how his time had been occupied,
he first ordered that the gags should be removed, and
then said to Captain Mansfield:</p>

<p>“I ’low it seems kinder rough for us to turn you out,
but that’s what we’ve decided to do, an’ there’s no use in
kickin’ up rusty about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>“Do you mean that we’re to be set adrift after doing
all we could to relieve your distress?” the captain asked,
huskily, for the gag had been in his mouth so long that it
was difficult to speak with sufficient distinctness to make
himself understood.</p>

<p>“That’s about the size of it,” the man replied, with a
drunken leer. “There’s jest a chance we might get into
trouble at Nassau, because the <em>Mary and Jane</em> was
lost&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you are responsible for the destruction of that
craft, eh?”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, or you may be askin’ questions
that’ll get you into trouble, for my mates won’t stand any
nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Then cut your own talk short. You have committed
a deed which will eventually bring you to the gallows, and
there is no reason why there should be any delay in finishing
the job like the pirates that you are,” Captain
Mansfield said, impatiently.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what we’re goin’ to do. Search the
crowd for fear they may have revolvers with them,” the
man said, with an assumption of authority, which would
have been comical under less desperate circumstances.</p>

<p>But few moments were required in order to execute
this command, and when the work was concluded the
helpless men had been robbed of everything valuable upon
their persons.</p>

<p>Captain Mansfield no longer attempted to speak; it was
as if his anger was too great to admit of words, but he
watched jealously every movement made by his enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></p>

<p>The sun was flooding the sea with a golden radiance
when the mutineers lowered one of the boats, put into her
a small cask of water and some provisions, and then stood
as if waiting for the rightful crew of the <em>Day Dream</em> to
take their departure.</p>

<p>At such a time resistance would have been worse than
useless, and, when his bonds had been removed, the captain
said, as he walked toward the rail:</p>

<p>“I warn you that the time will come when this high-handed
proceeding must be atoned for, and, if you have
any regard for your own necks, you will give us more of
a show for life.”</p>

<p>“What do you want now?” the leader asked, with an
oath.</p>

<p>“Two boats, and something to serve as sails. With
eight people on board one of these little tenders the first
strong puff of wind will send her to the bottom. Give
us as good a show as you would want for yourselves.”</p>

<p>“It’s a precious sight better than you deserve,” was
the brutal reply, as the helpless ones were hurried over
the rail, their united weight loading the craft down to
the gunwales.</p>

<p>From the time the gag had been removed until he clambered
into the boat old Andy had not spoken; but when
the painter was cast off and the schooner began to draw
away from them, his anger burst forth in a torrent of
threats and reproaches.</p>

<p>He called down all manner of curses on the heads of
sailors who would turn pirates immediately after having
been rescued from such a desolate spot as the key,<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
and predicted the result of these high-handed proceedings
in language so energetic that Captain Mansfield said,
sharply:</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Andy. You are doing them no harm, and
couldn’t better our condition if you talked all day.”</p>

<p>“I’se gwine ter let sich low down trash know wha’s
ercumin’ to ’em.”</p>

<p>“They’ll know it soon enough without any assistance
from you. Just now we’ve something more important to
think about, for unless we can make harbor on one of
the keys which lie hereabouts before a heavy blow comes
on, our chances for living will be pretty slim.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there any hope we can get our things back?”
Nelse asked, ruefully. “The thieves have even taken
my watch.”</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy we shall see even the smallest portion of
our property again,” the captain replied, with what was
very like a sigh. “They will get to fighting among themselves,
and wreck the little craft before long, unless,
which is not likely, a war vessel happens to overhaul
them.”</p>

<p>“Shall we get out the oars?” Mr. Jenkins asked. “We
should be near Spanish or Powel Key, and by rowing to
the eastward it ought to be possible to run the land down
by sunset.”</p>

<p>“You are right, and it’s to be turn and turn about for
all hands. Unfortunately only two can work at a time,
because we have no more oars, and the tricks shall be an
hour for each man.”</p>

<p>From this moment until nearly nightfall but little conversation<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
was indulged in; each occupant of the boat had
been robbed of all his effects, and this, in addition to the
outrage, was well calculated to make them feel the reverse
of cheerful.</p>

<p>The wind, which had so much weight in it at sunrise,
died away entirely about ten o’clock, and the heat was
most intense. Not even the lightest breath of air came
off the glassy water, and one hour was quite as long as
the strongest could remain at the oars.</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the afternoon a well-wooded key
was seen dead ahead, and two hours later the victims of
their own charitable act were on shore.</p>

<p>“We will stay here twenty-four hours,” Captain Mansfield
said, as the boat was pulled up into a narrow cove
which extended some distance inland, and terminated in
a veritable thicket of mangroves. “Then we’ll work our
way down the bank in the night, when we sha’n’t be so
nearly prostrated by the heat.”</p>

<p>It was a great relief to the boys to be able to stretch
their legs on shore, and when a spot was cleared that all
might lie down without fear of being disturbed by centipedes
or similar disagreeable things, they began to think
the situation was not as grave as it might have been.</p>

<p>A hearty meal of ship’s bread and canned meat was
followed by a desire to sleep, and the entire party lay
down to rest, for it was not necessary to stand watch.</p>

<p>Toward midnight the wind sprang up from the eastward,
but only to die away again a few hours later, and
Captain Mansfield said to the mate, in a tone of satisfaction,
as the two arose just as day was breaking:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>“If there were any vessels nearby last evening we
should get a glimpse of a sail when the sun rises, for
that breeze must have given them a slant toward this
key.”</p>

<p>“By swarming up one of the largest trees we can have
quite a range of vision, and something ought to be heaving
in sight before night. I’ll stand the first trick.”</p>

<p>“With nothing else to&mdash;&mdash; Hark!”</p>

<p>As the captain spoke a creaking sound was heard, and
he finished the sentence by saying, joyfully:</p>

<p>“It seems that we sha’n’t have long to wait. There
is some kind of a craft becalmed within a quarter of a
mile of the shore.”</p>

<p>“There can be no question about that. Shall we hail
her?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t necessary. She can’t get away until the breeze
springs up, and we may as well know who we are asking
for assistance. I am not putting as much faith in my fellow-man
as I was before our experience of yesterday.”</p>

<p>The two walked down the bank of the cove to the
beach, where a full view of the seaboard could be had,
and there waited for the rising sun to show them the
newcomer.</p>

<p>The shaft of radiance soon came out of the sea, gilding
each crestless wave with a glory of brightness, and revealing
to the watchers the spars of a jaunty-looking
schooner so near the land that it seemed as if one could
have tossed a pebble on her deck.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins stood staring at the little craft in open-mouthed
astonishment as if doubting the evidence of his<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
own senses, until Captain Mansfield pulled him roughly
back into the shelter of the foliage, as he whispered excitedly:</p>

<p>“It’s the <em>Day Dream</em> herself.”</p>

<p>“For a moment I thought my eyes were playing me a
trick,” the mate said, with a long-drawn breath of bewilderment.
“What are we to do? Show ourselves?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. We must form a plan of action, for if this
calm holds until noon the little craft shall be in our possession
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">TURNING THE TABLES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The first thing to be done was to warn the remainder
of the party that the mutineers were close at hand, lest
some incautious noise might betray the fact of their being
on the key, and to this end Captain Mansfield hurried to
the head of the little cove.</p>

<p>Old Andy was the only one awake, and to him the captain
whispered:</p>

<p>“The villains who seized the <em>Day Dream</em> are becalmed
within twenty fathoms of the shore. See to it that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The darky looked up in alarm, his eyes seemingly starting
from their sockets, and he was on the verge of giving
vent to a cry of fear when Captain Mansfield seized him
by the throat.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare so much as wink, or I’ll choke the
breath out of your body,” he whispered, angrily, and the
old man sank to his knees the very personification of
terror. “Now listen carefully, and see that you do as I
tell you. See to it that there is no noise made here.
When the others awake tell them to remain quiet until
I return.”</p>

<p>There was no longer any danger that Andy would betray
the secret by an incautious move. The threat terrified
him even more than the knowledge of the mutineers’<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
whereabouts, and Captain Mansfield retraced his steps
to the point where he had left the mate.</p>

<p>During the short time he had been absent the general
condition of affairs on the schooner’s deck was changed
considerably.</p>

<p>The mutineers had come from below, probably after
a night’s debauch, and the sound of angry conversation
told that a quarrel was imminent.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” the captain asked Mr. Jenkins,
in a whisper.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. They came out of the cabin a few
seconds ago, and this row appears to be a continuation
of what started below.”</p>

<p>“It will be a fortunate happening for us, if they get
into a fight.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” the mate replied, hesitatingly; “but I fail
to see how it is going to be possible for us to accomplish
anything without weapons when that crowd are well
armed, if they have taken the trouble to search the cabin,
which I reckon has been done long before this.”</p>

<p>“We shall find a way out of it, if the calm continues.
Give me a chance to get over the bow before they know
we’re in the vicinity, and I’ll take the risk of their
weapons.”</p>

<p>The discussion on the yacht was fast degenerating into
a regular row. The men were talking so loudly that a
reasonably good idea of the condition of affairs could
be gained by the listeners.</p>

<p>Several of the mutineers were insisting on making this
particular key a sort of rendezvous, and demanding that<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
a certain lot of goods (probably something they had saved
from the <em>Mary and Jane</em>) should be brought here.</p>

<p>Another faction, and among them the leader, wanted
to run for the Florida Straits, in order to remain hidden
among the keys until search for the yacht should be
abandoned. They believed, and with good reason, that
Captain Mansfield would not tamely submit to the loss of
his vessel, and, since the weather had been favorable for
navigation in a small boat, it was more than probable
those who had been dispossessed would succeed in reaching
Nassau.</p>

<p>Greatly to the disappointment of the two concealed
among the foliage on shore, the men did not come to
blows, although each instant it seemed as if such would
be the case. After squabbling for twenty minutes or
more the mutineers appeared to have come to some kind
of an understanding, and a quantity of the cabin stores
were brought on deck for breakfast.</p>

<p>Each one appeared to be his own cook, and the wastefulness
displayed would have brought tears of vexation to
Andy’s eyes. A tin of beef, which one fellow opened,
was tossed overboard after he had taken out two slices.</p>

<p>A box of biscuit was left on the house that each might
help himself, and the greater portion used in firing on
a wager at a floating bottle.</p>

<p>This kind of horseplay came to an end finally, and
then the half-drunken crew began lowering one of the
boats.</p>

<p>“It is possible that our opportunity is near at hand,”
Captain Mansfield whispered. “It looks as if some of<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
them were coming ashore, and it is time the rest of our
party were ready for action. Creep back softly, and
send them to me. Then pole our boat as near the mouth
of the cove as is safe.”</p>

<p>By a chance as fortunate and unexpected as had been
the coming of the <em>Day Dream</em>, all the mutineers but two
prepared to go on shore, and, as nearly as Captain Mansfield
could judge, each man had armed himself either with
a rifle or revolver, thus exhausting the supply of weapons
on board.</p>

<p>“It will be nothing more than child’s play now, provided
they do not land too near here,” he whispered to
himself, and just as the boats pushed off from the
schooner, Gil and Nelse crept close to the watcher’s side.</p>

<p>“Is there any chance of our getting the yacht again?”
the former asked; but his father motioned for him to
be silent.</p>

<p>The remainder of the party came up before the mutineers
were half-a-dozen yards from the vessel, and a few
moments later Captain Mansfield saw, to his dismay, that
the men intended to land directly in front of his hiding-place.</p>

<p>It seemed as if this must be a deathblow to all his
plans, and the boys mentally braced themselves for the
struggle both believed to be at hand.</p>

<p>The men rowed leisurely, singing and laughing, evidently
fancying themselves the only human beings in the
vicinity, and the little tender struck the beach not more
than a dozen feet from where the anxious ones were concealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>The bows of the boats were pulled up on the sand to
prevent them from drifting away, and then the mutineers
pushed straight on into the thicket, probably bent on exploring
the key to learn if it would serve them as a rendezvous.</p>

<p>They were making so much noise that the watchers
might have conversed in ordinary tones; but Captain
Mansfield did not take any such chances, when he whispered
to Gil:</p>

<p>“You and Nelse go back to where Jenkins is waiting
with the boat. Send him to me, and get on board. Move
cautiously down to the very mouth of the cove, and stay
there, with oars in the rowlocks, until you see us push one
of these crafts from the shore. Then row for the schooner
the best you know how.”</p>

<p>This was no time to ask questions, and the orders
were obeyed instantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins was but a short distance away, and when
Gil had repeated his father’s instructions the mate hurried
off, leaving the boys to carry out their part of the
programme unaided.</p>

<p>“Father is probably going to try to get hold of the
other two boats,” Gil whispered, as he clambered inboard,
“and if the mutineers see us while we are pulling out to
the schooner we shall have the chance of learning how it
seems to be shot at.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather receive a pretty serious wound than let those
scoundrels go off with the yacht again, now there’s a
possibility of our gaining possession once more,” Nelse
said, and by the time he ceased speaking both were in the<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
little craft, each with an oar ready to pull at the first signal.</p>

<p>The voices of the mutineers now sounded from a distance,
and it was not likely they could have a view of the
water because of the intervening foliage; but yet Captain
Mansfield’s party gave no sign of action.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed, and Gil was beginning to grow
alarmed lest his father should wait too long, when a light
splash of water was heard, and one of the tenders shot
out from the shore with the two sailors rowing and Andy
at the helm.</p>

<p>“Now bend to it,” Gil whispered, hoarsely. “Watch
to see that one doesn’t pull the other around, for there
mustn’t be any wild steering.”</p>

<p>The boys were out of the cove just as the captain and
Mr. Jenkins launched the last boat, and all three crafts
were dashing over the glassy sea in fine style, sending
tiny showers of spray up from their bows, when a loud
yell was heard.</p>

<p>The two fellows on the schooner had caught a glimpse
of the captain’s party, and were shouting for their friends.</p>

<p>“It’s a question of reaching the other side of the yacht
before they heave in sight, or we may come to grief,” Gil
said, grimly, as he bent his back to the oar until the
ashen blade bent under the vigorous strain.</p>

<p>“Board her over the rail amidships, boys!” Captain
Mansfield shouted, and glancing around for the merest
fraction of time, Nelse saw that the sailors were steering
for the schooner’s bow, while the other boat was being
sent toward the stern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>By thus dividing the force, the mutineers would be
beset both from front and rear, while Gil and Nelse
created diversion on one side, and the struggle could not
be long protracted.</p>

<p>The men on the yacht were yelling at the full strength
of their lungs, and stood near the bow with handspikes
raised ready to fell the first who should attempt to come
on board; but they could not guard the stern at the same
time, therefore the captain and mate succeeded in clambering
over the rail before the fellows were fully aware of
their purpose.</p>

<p>The boys had just pulled around the <em>Day Dream</em> when
the main body of mutineers burst out of the bushes, and
the shower of bullets which they sent, without waiting
to take accurate aim, did no injury to any one.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins had opened the battle by hurling a handspike
with such good effect that the taller sailor was
knocked over like a ninepin, and the other, realizing how
useless it would be to contend against such odds, leaped
into the sea, swimming for dear life as those on the
shore continued to discharge their weapons.</p>

<p>“Keep under the rail as much as possible,” Captain
Mansfield shouted, as he set the example by crouching
where he could get a view of the shore without exposing
too much of his body. “They can’t have any very great
amount of ammunition, and it isn’t likely either of that
crowd has got the nerve to swim out here.”</p>

<p>Andy was the only one who did not follow this suggestion
instantly. The old darky was so elated at the complete<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
turning of the tables that it seemed absolutely necessary
to give vent in some way to his joy.</p>

<p>He danced around the deck in full view of the angry
men on shore, shouting in a sing-song tone:</p>

<p>“Wese done got de bes’ ob dem villyns! Glory to de
Lam’! Wese ’board de yacht once mo’! Glory to de
Lam’! Wese gwine&mdash;&mdash; Hi, yi, yi!”</p>

<p>These last exclamations were by no means a portion of
his song of triumph; but just at that moment a bullet
from one of the rifles had grazed the top of his ear, causing
more pain than a really serious wound would have
done, and, with a howl of terror, he flung himself down
by Captain Mansfield’s side, where he alternately moaned
and continued to cry:</p>

<p>“Glory to de Lam’!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">BOUND SOUTH.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>After having fired four or five rounds of ammunition
without other effect than the grazing of Andy’s ear, the
mutineers appeared to have grown tired of such useless
work, and ceased to waste their cartridges.</p>

<p>The calm was still “raging.” There was not wind
enough to have caused any perceptible motion in a
feather, and those who had taken possession of their own
again could not do otherwise than remain idle, waiting
for that which, by filling the white sails, would carry
them far from their enemies.</p>

<p>On the shore the mutineers sat watching the schooner,
unable to do anything toward regaining her, and, as
Jenkins expressed it, “eating their hearts out” with anger,
because they had been so foolish as to take all the weapons
ashore, leaving the ship-keepers virtually defenseless.</p>

<p>The man who had been bowled over by a belaying-pin
recovered consciousness after the firing ceased, and, with
a very disagreeable sensation in his head, sat on the main
hatch, probably wondering what was to become of him.</p>

<p>“Are you going to keep that thing?” the mate asked
of Captain Mansfield, pointing over his shoulder with
his thumb at the disconsolate-looking mutineer.</p>

<p>“Let him swim ashore when there’s a chance of our
crawling away from this key.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<p>“Why not use him first?”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“If a breeze should spring up now those fellows on
the beach would amuse themselves by making targets of
us while we were raising the anchor and making sail.”</p>

<p>“I have thought of that; but do not see how it is to be
avoided.”</p>

<p>“Make this fellow do such work as he can, with our
assistance, while we remain under cover. Give me the
word and I’ll guarantee to have the little craft ready for
the first cat’s-paw which comes over the sea, and without
exposing myself.”</p>

<p>“Act as you please, Mr. Jenkins. It is no more than
fair that he should do something to repay for the trouble
and loss which his crowd have cost us.”</p>

<p>The mate could have asked for no more congenial
task, and Andy was in an ecstacy of delight as the mutineer
was forced to play the part of a barricade for the
others.</p>

<p>At first the man appeared disposed to rebel against
doing the work demanded of him; but Mr. Jenkins said,
sternly, brandishing a belaying-pin to give greater emphasis
to his words:</p>

<p>“You ought to have a pretty good idea by this time
that we shouldn’t feel very bad to be obliged to break
your head, and that’s exactly what will happen if you
don’t step lively. It may be well to tell those scoundrels
on the beach who it is doing this work, otherwise they
might put a bullet into your hide.”</p>

<p>The fellow began to realize that his captors were not<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
to be trifled with, and very meekly went to the rail, where
he shouted:</p>

<p>“Hi! Mike! This crowd have got the drop on me,
an’ I’m bound to do as they say; so don’t shoot, will yer?”</p>

<p>“Why not swim ashore? They can’t do anything, if
you only show a little nerve, ’cause we’ve got all the
shootin’ irons.”</p>

<p>“My leg’s about the same as broken, ’an I couldn’t
swim a stroke.”</p>

<p>Mike was silent for a few seconds, and then he asked:</p>

<p>“Is the captain countin’ on leaving us here?”</p>

<p>“You have brought it on yourselves, and can be mighty
certain that we wouldn’t raise a finger to help you now,
if the whole gang was starving,” Captain Mansfield
shouted from his place of vantage under the rail.</p>

<p>The mutineers began to understand that a speedy punishment
was about to overtake them, and the leader cried
in a whining tone:</p>

<p>“We’ll die for the want of something to drink, if you
leave us.”</p>

<p>“There’s little chance the world will be so lucky as to
get rid of you. I shall notify the authorities at Nassau
of your whereabouts, as well as of the likelihood that at
least a portion of the brig’s cargo will be found on
Walker Key, and I reckon you’ll not be left alone very
long.”</p>

<p>This acted like a douche of cold water upon the mutineers,
who were also, probably, wreckers, and they exhibited
every symptom of uneasiness.</p>

<p>“It is time for you to go to work,” Mr. Jenkins said<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
to his prisoner. “Get into the boat with me, and we’ll
pull the schooner’s head around so your friends won’t
have so good a chance to interfere with us while we
weigh the anchor; but remember that if you attempt to
give me the slip, I’ll split your head open with this,”
and the mate flourished the belaying-pin savagely.</p>

<p>Sheltered from those on the shore by the yacht herself,
this portion of the task could be done in comparative
safety, and while one of the sailors payed out on the
cable the craft was swung around stern on.</p>

<p>Then the men managed to rig up the quarter-deck awning
as a screen, without exposing themselves very much,
and all hands could now work while hidden from view of
the angry scoundrels on the shore.</p>

<p>After this had been done the anchor was weighed, and
then the two in the boat pulled and tugged at the oars
until the <em>Day Dream</em> was fully a mile from the shore.</p>

<p>This had not been accomplished without some show of
remonstrance from the mutineers. When the yacht first
began to move through the water, and they understood
what was being done, a volley of bullets was discharged
at random, many finding their way through the canvas
screen; but finally this useless evidence of rage ceased,
probably because the ammunition had been exhausted.</p>

<p>Not until they were beyond range did Mr. Jenkins allow
his prisoner to cease his efforts, and then, wiping the
perspiration from his face, he said:</p>

<p>“Now there is nothing to prevent your going ashore,
if you feel so disposed.”</p>

<p>“Will you let the men pull me in to that point?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[73]</span></p>

<p>“Not much. What is to prevent your swimming?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do it, even if there were no sharks hereabout,
as there are sure to be. My leg feels as if it was
broken.”</p>

<p>“You got off cheaply, and that’s more than can be said
for the rest of the gang, since they will have to answer to
the authorities for what has been done. If you don’t
want to swim, get on board, for I sha’n’t give you the
chance of stealing one of these boats.”</p>

<p>The man obeyed without another word, and once on
the schooner he crouched under the rail forward as if
anxious to escape observation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as soon as the yacht was at a reasonably
safe distance from the shore, Gil and Nelse went below
to learn what the mutineers had done there, and the
scene which met their gaze was well calculated to fill
them with mingled feelings of anger and dismay.</p>

<p>One would have said that a hundred men had been
amusing themselves with trying to see how much mischief
could be done in a given length of time. The contents
of the staterooms were dragged into the cabin,
where they might be examined leisurely, and left lying
on the floor. Food of all kinds was scattered in every
direction, and as much wasted as would have served the
rightful crew of the yacht for many days.</p>

<p>“We ought to be thankful we have got the <em>Day Dream</em>
back in any condition,” Gil said, with a long-drawn sigh;
“but it is more than provoking to think we gave that
crowd the opportunity of destroying things.”</p>

<p>“All the weapons, watches and money are gone,” Nelse<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
added; “but from what your father said I don’t fancy the
amount of cash is enough to make them very rich, and
we’ll soon repair damages, so it won’t pay to mourn a
great deal. Let’s do what we can toward setting things
to rights.”</p>

<p>While the boys were engaged in this work, Andy was
surveying his quarters, and if harsh words could have
injured the mutineers, not one would have been left alive
five minutes after he saw the condition of his kitchen.</p>

<p>They had not spent so much time in the galley as aft;
but the same scene of wanton destruction met the cook’s
gaze, and he attributed the greater portion of it to the
voudoos, whose especial domains the boys had threatened
to invade.</p>

<p>“Dere’s gwine ter be de berry debbil raised on dis yere
cruise, ef de captain consists in runnin’ to Hayti,” he
muttered, while trying to repair the damage. “I’se done
gone boun’ ter tork ter dem boys ag’in, kase dey mus’
know wha’s sartin ter happen, ef dat pirates’ gol’ ain’ got
out ob dere min’s.”</p>

<p>During this time those on deck had not been idle. Every
inch of canvas belonging to the yacht was spread to catch
the first breath of air which should come over the sea, and
the captain and mate amused themselves by watching the
mutineers, who still remained on the beach as if unable
to understand that they had lost the little craft so suddenly.</p>

<p>“There comes what we are waiting for,” Mr. Jenkins
said, as he pointed toward the west, where a faint ruffling
of the water into a deeper blue betokened the rising<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
of the wind. “Now, what is to be done with the fellow
forward?”</p>

<p>“Call him aft, and let him decide the question.”</p>

<p>The man obeyed Mr. Jenkins’ summons in a slouchy,
shamefaced manner, touching his hat when he reached
the quarter-deck, and standing there as if expecting punishment
was about to be meted out to him.</p>

<p>“We hope to be under way in a short time,” Captain
Mansfield began, “and you are to say what is to become
of your precious self. I should be warranted in taking
you to Nassau in chains; but it will be too much trouble.”</p>

<p>“I would like to be set ashore, sir.”</p>

<p>“You can leave at any time; but I don’t propose the
men shall exert themselves in your behalf by so much as
pulling an oar.”</p>

<p>“I can’t swim,” the man said, piteously.</p>

<p>“That may be; but if we row you ashore your precious
friends will probably gain possession of the boat, considering
the fact that they are well armed, while we would
be helpless.”</p>

<p>“I can rig up a sort of raft on which he could manage
to reach the land,” Mr. Jenkins ventured to say, observing
that the captain hesitated.</p>

<p>“Very well; if he chooses to go in that manner, I have
no objection,” and Captain Mansfield turned away, for
he was eager to be rid of the mutineer, but did not propose
to take any risks.</p>

<p>Two empty casks, with a plank from one to the other,
formed quite a seaworthy raft for one man, and ten minutes
later, just as the oncoming breeze filled the yacht’s<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
sails, the mutineer was paddling for dear life toward the
key.</p>

<p>There was no time to watch his movements, for the
<em>Day Dream</em> began to draw away from the land in a manner
which told that the run to Nassau would be quickly
an accomplished fact, providing the wind held.</p>

<p>Once more the yacht was bound south, and, despite
all the misfortunes which Andy persisted in believing
were caused by the voudoos, Gil and Nelse allowed themselves
to dream again of the pirates’ gold.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HAYTI.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>One could easily fancy how much the mutineers must
have been punished by seeing the schooner moving
swiftly away from the land, knowing as they did that
the officers of the law would soon come in search of
them, and more than one on board the <em>Day Dream</em> was
satisfied with this as atonement for all the discomforts
suffered during the last thirty hours.</p>

<p>It was impossible to say whether the fellow who had
just been released ever reached the shore, although all
the chances were in his favor. The last that could be
seen of him through the glass was when the schooner
rounded the point of land which marked the eastern-most
extremity of the key, and then he was paddling for
dear life.</p>

<p>It surely seemed as if the wind had come to stay for
some time. It continued to increase in weight until
nightfall, when the yacht had as much as she needed in
such waters, and Mr. Jenkins confidently announced to
Gil and Nelse that they would be at Nassau before sunset
on the following day.</p>

<p>Time proved this prediction to be correct.</p>

<p>By six o’clock on the same day the yacht had been recaptured,
all evidences of her late unlawful crew were<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
wiped out both fore and aft, and when the boys retired
the thought of their slight losses, as compared to what
might have been, went very far toward consoling them.</p>

<p>“Father will buy us such things as we may need when
we get into port,” Gil said, confidently, to his cousin,
“and if he doesn’t think it necessary to replace our
watches, no great harm will be done, if we are obliged
to look at the cabin clock in order to learn when the
meals should be served.”</p>

<p>“I’m not worrying about the stuff those fellows took
from us,” Nelse replied; “but am only afraid uncle won’t
allow us to hunt for the treasure because of what has
already happened.”</p>

<p>“That will be all right, as you will see, so let’s try not
to think any more of what has happened.”</p>

<p>At noon on the following day, the boys almost forgot
the disagreeable adventures with the mutineers when
they landed at Nassau with Mr. Jenkins, and made a tour
of the sponge yards, while Captain Mansfield went to inform
the authorities of those whom he believed were responsible
for the loss of the <em>Mary and Jane</em>.</p>

<p>It was a particularly pleasant day which they spent
ashore, viewing the many wonders wrested from the bed
of the ocean, and on returning to the schooner neither
thought to ask what had been done until Captain Mansfield
was speaking with the mate about the officers of the
ill-fated brig.</p>

<p>“There can be no question but that those fellows had
a hand in the wrecking of the <em>Mary and Jane</em>,” he said.
“The captain and mates landed here last week, and told<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
me to-day there could be no doubt as to the facts. On
three different occasions it was found that the brig was
many points off her course, and I fancy the men knew
exactly where she would be foundered.”</p>

<p>“Will the authorities send to arrest them?” Gil asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly, and the officers of the brig intend to urge
it; besides, they propose to start at once for Walker Key
in the hope that some of the cargo may be there.”</p>

<p>“Were the men really deserted?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, according to the captain’s story, and
after what we have experienced I would believe him
against a thousand such as tried to run away with the
schooner. It seems that when the brig struck, the men
were ordered into the boats; but they refused to leave
until the spirits had been divided. The crowd we met
insisted on using the gig, and, holding her fast alongside,
proceeded to get drunk. A heavy sea was running, and
after the officers had expostulated with the men for some
time, they believed there was nothing left but to look
out for their own lives. The vessel was fast breaking up,
and the crew in a drunken condition, when the captain’s
party finally put off to try to reach this port, which they
did in four days. A schooner was sent out from here;
but nothing could be found either of the crew or of the
craft, and it was generally believed that she slid off into
deep water and sank.”</p>

<p>“Now what will happen?” Gil asked.</p>

<p>“I think it is safe to say the fellows will find themselves
in a very disagreeable position before many days have
elapsed,” Captain Mansfield replied, and then he was<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
summoned on deck by the arrival of the goods which
he had purchased to replace those stolen by the mutineers.</p>

<p>From this time until they were ready to “turn in” the
boys had plenty to occupy their attention. The new
weapons, additional stores, and such other articles as the
captain had bought, were inspected. The things were
stowed in their proper places, and then once more the
question as to whether the treasure could be found came
up for discussion.</p>

<p>Not until a very late hour were the boys ready to retire,
owing to the many exciting topics of conversation, and
both were awakened next morning at sunrise by Mr. Jenkins,
who said, cheerily:</p>

<p>“Turn out lively, lads, for there is a good deal to be seen
from here until we are well through the channel, and the
yacht is already under way.”</p>

<p>When they came on deck the <em>Day Dream</em> was opposite
the southernmost point of Great Abaco Island, and the
singular formation of rock known as the “Hole in the
Wall” was in full view.</p>

<p>The schooner was gliding slowly along under the influence
of the gentle morning breeze, and Gil and Nelse had
a good opportunity of seeing the odd sights, foremost
among which was Spanish Wells, the name of the town
on St. George’s Key, at the extreme northwest point of
the Island of Eleuthera, where the houses are built on
raised platforms, like many in the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<p>The mate explained that this singular style of architecture
was adopted because of the hermit-crabs, which<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
sometimes come ashore in vast numbers, ravaging the
land and entering every building not on stilts.</p>

<p>Then the cocoanut groves, two miles farther along the
coast, were seen, the flame-colored and scarlet blossoms
serving to form a most gorgeous picture.</p>

<p>A hasty breakfast, and the boys were on deck again
to see the “Glass Window,” a curious and perfect arch
of limestone eighty-five feet above the surface of the sea.
Not many years ago, so Mr. Jenkins said, a pleasure
party were dining there, when suddenly a great tidal-wave
came rushing in from the ocean, dashed up under
the arch, and swept the greater number of the merry-makers
away.</p>

<p>Such waves, coming without the slightest warning, are
frequent here. The natives call them “rages,” and believe
they are caused by storms some distance off on the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>Still farther down the coast is New Gregory’s Harbor,
where the wonderful cave, extending more than eleven
hundred feet under the ground, is located; but, of course,
this could not be seen from the schooner.</p>

<p>There were, in fact, so many wonderful things to attract
the curious during this run down the chain of
islands that the boys actually grew tired of the variety,
and in sheer weariness turned their attention to what
both seemed to think was the true purpose of the voyage.</p>

<p>“Will it be many days before we arrive at Hayti?” Gil
asked the mate, and the latter replied:</p>

<p>“If the wind favors we shall wind this portion of the<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
cruise up in short order. The captain intends to run
down as far as Silver Key Passage, and then we can
head nearly due west.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and tell Andy how near we are to the home
of the voudoos,” Nelse suggested, and the two went at
once to the galley, where the information was imparted
without loss of time.</p>

<p>The old darky looked at them pityingly for some seconds,
and then, shaking his head mournfully, he said:</p>

<p>“You’se rushin’ on ter destruction, dat’s wha’ you’se
doin’, an’ when de time cums dat dere’s no help fur you,
I’se sartin nobuddy won’t call Andy Storts er fool.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do when we land?” Gil asked,
trying hard to prevent himself from laughing.</p>

<p>“I’se done gone ’range up a plan ob my own.”</p>

<p>“And decided not to desert us?”</p>

<p>“Dere’s no kin’ ob use tryin’ ter run away frum de debbil,
kase it carn’t be did. Ef de captain’s boun’ fur ter
git hisself in trubble, an’ you boys won’t try ter dissuade
him from it, I’se gwine ter take keer ob myself. Don’
dat stan’ to reason?”</p>

<p>“You are right, Andy,” Nelse replied, laughingly; “but
please tell us what your plan is.”</p>

<p>“It carn’t be did, honey, kase de voudoos wud git hol’
ob it, an’ den whar’d de ole man be? I’se bin studyin’
an’ studyin’ sence we got de schooner back, an’ now I’se
feelin’ toller’bly easy in my min’.”</p>

<p>“Then by not telling us the secret, you show yourself
willing that we shall come to grief.”</p>

<p>“Honey, dem as rushes ’roun’ whar dey don’ b’long<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
mus’ take de chances, an’ ole Andy couldn’t dissuade yer
ter took his adwise.”</p>

<p>With this sage remark, spoken in the most sepulchral
of tones, the cook turned his attention once more to the
savory dish he was preparing for the cabin table, and it
was all in vain that the boys tried to prolong the conversation.</p>

<p>From this time until the schooner finally came to
anchor off the northern shore of the Tortuga de Mar,
nothing of especial interest occurred to vary the monotony
of the voyage.</p>

<p>The wind favored them in the most satisfactory manner,
and the little craft glided among the many keys in
perfect safety until on a certain night about ten o’clock
the longed-for spot was reached.</p>

<p>The boys had been on deck in a perfect fever of excitement
during the entire day; but, owing to the darkness,
it was impossible to gain any idea of the small body of
land where they believed so much treasure would be found
by them.</p>

<p>“We must curb our impatience until morning, I suppose,”
Gil said, with a sigh; “but I would have liked a
chance to compare the conformation of the land with our
chart.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to bed now?” Nelse asked.</p>

<p>“What would be the use? I couldn’t close my eyes
in sleep yet awhile.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s slip into the galley, and see if Andy is putting
his wonderful plan into operation. I am eager to<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
find out how he proposes to assure his own safety while
the debbil is getting hold of us.”</p>

<p>Gil was more than willing to act upon this suggestion,
since it would serve to help pass away the time until they
wished to “turn in,” and the two went below to the
kitchen, where, to their great surprise, the door was found
securely locked.</p>

<p>They knocked again and again without receiving a
reply, and as one of the sailors passed, Gil asked:</p>

<p>“Do you know where Andy is?”</p>

<p>“In there, and he don’t mean to open the door for
anybody. I reckon he’s up to some of his funny business,
’cause he’s so afraid of what may be found on the
island.”</p>

<p>The boys tried again to make the old darky answer;
but he steadily refused, and they were finally forced to
return to the deck.</p>

</div>


<p>During this evening Gil and Nelse could do no more
than speculate as to whether it would be possible to find
a conformation of the coast similar to the one shown by
the rude chart, and since this question was to be settled
definitely in such a comparatively short space of time
neither Captain Mansfield nor Mr. Jenkins would so
much as take part in the conversation.</p>

<p>Even the exciting thoughts of discovering pirates’
treasure were not sufficient to prevent them from feeling
sleepy after a while, more especially when all save the
watch had turned in, and at midnight they crept into the
little stateroom.</p>

<p>Both the boys lay down with the determination to be
on deck at the first sign of dawn, and yet the sun was
half an hour high before either opened his eyes.</p>

<p>Nelse was the first to awaken, and he cried, in a tone
of deepest anxiety, as if believing the delay might in some
manner result to their injury:</p>

<p>“Get up, Gil! If this is the way we set about hunting
for gold there won’t be a very good chance of finding
any. We should have been on deck two hours ago.”</p>

<p>This summons was sufficient to bring Gil to his feet instantly,
and, after a hurried toilet, the two were leaning<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
over the rail aft, with the well-worn and enigmatical piece
of brown paper spread out where it could be studied at
their leisure.</p>

<p>When they first gained the deck Andy was coming
from the galley to the cabin with the morning meal; but
both the would-be treasure seekers were in such a high
state of excitement that they actually forgot their curiosity
of the previous night, and did not even think to ask
what steps he had taken to insure his safety against the
dreaded voudoos.</p>

<p>“If that was intended as a chart of the Tortuga de
Mar the schooner is in the best possible place for you to
go ahead with the work,” Mr. Jenkins said, as he approached
the boys. “There’s the point of land, with a
rock or bit of coral to the nor’ard of it, an’ dead as the
bowsprit shows is the cove with what I take to be soundings;
but have you fellows figured out the meaning of the
other things?”</p>

<p>“We think the drawing of the schooner with a lead-line
on which is the figure eight, hanging from her bowsprit
means that only a small craft with a draught of not
over eight feet can get in there,” Gil replied.</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s right, though it was a waste of time
an’ lead pencil to make the craft after showing the soundings.”</p>

<p>“Then the letters and figures on this stick, and the
straight lines on the side, refer to the same thing, which
is that from a certain tree&mdash;for those scratches must have
been made to represent foliage&mdash;at a distance of eighteen<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
feet and eight inches north, then five feet west, the treasure
will be found.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve figured it out better than I expected,”
Mr. Jenkins said, approvingly; “but how do you know
whether the measurements are in feet, yards or fathoms?”</p>

<p>“That part of it is guesswork, of course. I don’t think
it can mean fathoms, because of the fraction eight, therefore
it will only be necessary to try the feet and yards,
which can’t be such a great amount of work.”</p>

<p>“No,” the mate replied, slowly and thoughtfully, “not
if this is the place, or if you find the right tree, or if
there’s any treasure buried on the island; but according
to my way of thinking it’ll be a decently hard job to decide
exactly where the sights should be taken from, considering
the fact that this part of the island is fairly well
wooded.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Jenkins walked away, for the cook had announced
that breakfast was served, and the boys were
again plunged into a disagreeable state of uncertainty
because of the difficulty they would undoubtedly have in
trying to decide which was the landmark referred to on
the supposed chart.</p>

<p>Andy did not so much as look at Gil and Nelse when
they came into the cabin. It seemed as if he tried to
avoid meeting their eyes, and during all the time they
were talking with Captain Mansfield relative to the finding
of the tree, he stood just inside the pantry making
some of the most extraordinary gestures possible.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to prevent your going ashore with
Mr. Jenkins, if you feel so disposed,” Gil’s father said, as<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
he finished his meal. “I am not inclined to any such exercise,
but can manage to pass the time with some degree
of comfort while the search is made.”</p>

<p>The boys had hoped the captain would become interested
in the proposed work when they were where an investigation
could be made; but this last remark showed
that he did not intend to have anything to do with the
decidedly mythical treasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins, however, was not only ready but eager for
a trip ashore, and, without waiting for orders, he caused
one of the tenders to be lowered.</p>

<p>If there were any inhabitants on this end of the island
they had kept well out of sight, and to guard against a
possible attack by wild animals the boys armed themselves
with revolvers as well as rifles.</p>

<p>There was plenty of work aboard for the sailors, therefore
the treasure-seekers were expected to do their own
rowing, and, with all hands except Andy watching from
the rail, they started, heading directly for the cove.</p>

<p>Gil suggested that, in order to make certain the narrow
strip of water was the one they were anxious to find,
soundings be made. If the depth of water should coincide
with the fifteen, ten and eight of the chart it would
afford a certain degree of proof, but to this Mr. Jenkins
objected.</p>

<p>“It would be only a waste of time,” he said. “The bottom
so near inshore shifts every year, and you couldn’t
even rely on a Government chart.”</p>

<p>“I thought from what we read in the newspaper clipping<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
that the island was small,” Nelse said, as the boat
neared the shore. “It looks pretty big from here.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-two miles long and five wide, according to
the geographies,” the mate replied, with a laugh, “so you
see there’s plenty of room for adventure in case Andy’s
voudoos really make this place their headquarters.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in anything of the kind?”</p>

<p>“That the negroes of Hayti practice the rites of voudooism
there can be no doubt; but of course the cook has
exaggerated matters.”</p>

<p>By this time the little tender’s bow had been run up on
the sandy beach, and, after looking carefully around to
make certain no one was lurking in the vicinity, the party
landed.</p>

<p>The boat was made fast, and Gil led the way on
what now seemed a hopeless task, that of finding a tree
so old as to give promise of being the one from which
the proper bearings might be taken, if indeed there was
anything proper or positive in the document they had discovered.</p>

<p>The foliage was dense; so matted in places as to render
it difficult for the travelers to force a passage through,
and thus they were obliged to go blindly on, passing near
perhaps the very object for which they were searching.</p>

<p>There were many birds to be seen and heard, but no
other form of animal life was found during the tramp, except
once when a hog, probably a descendant from those
brought to the island by the original buccaneers, dashed
out of the thicket, almost overturning Nelse, and disappearing<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
again before either of the party had an opportunity
to fire a single shot.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour, when they were three miles from
the beach, as nearly as could be judged, the mate threw
himself on the ground as he said, impatiently:</p>

<p>“It is foolish to keep on in this manner. We haven’t
come across a tree of any size after walking this distance,
although we know there were very many to be seen in
the immediate vicinity from the schooner’s deck.”</p>

<p>“The undergrowth is so dense that we shouldn’t know
it if one was a dozen feet away,” Nelse replied, fanning
himself vigorously, for the heat at this point, where the
cooling breezes from the sea could not penetrate, was almost
stifling.</p>

<p>“Then there’s all the more reason why we should go
back, mark out a course, and follow it by a compass.”</p>

<p>“But I counted on finding what we wanted straight
across from the end of the cove,” Gil said, disconsolately.</p>

<p>“It isn’t yet certain that it can’t be discovered,” the
mate replied, laughingly. “We are not woodsmen enough
to travel a beeline without anything to guide us.”</p>

<p>“It’s positive we’re wasting time roaming around in
this manner, so let’s go back.”</p>

<p>“Hold on a little while. I am so nearly roasted that
there will be nothing left of me but perspiration if I am
forced to take any exercise right away,” Nelse cried, in
affected distress.</p>

<p>Each member of the party was more than willing to indulge
in a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i> just at this time, and, following the example
set by the mate the boys stretched themselves out<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
at full length, regardless alike of snakes or the worshipers
of voudoo.</p>

<p>Everything was conducive to slumber, save the winged
pests which were particularly active, and, despite even
these, all three were soon sleeping soundly; so much so, in
fact, that two half-naked negroes passed within three feet
of where they were lying without arousing them.</p>

<p>This was possible owing to the fact that the strangers
walked with exceeding caution, finding an open way
through the foliage where seemingly none existed, and
circling around the sleepers without so much as a rustling
of the leaves.</p>

<p>These men must certainly have been aware that the
schooner had come to an anchor off the island during the
night, for they evinced no surprise at seeing the whites,
but scrutinized them carefully, as if trying to judge of
their character.</p>

<p>For fully five minutes the fellows continued the silent
examination, and then they glided through the thicket toward
the direction where the yacht was lying.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Mr. Jenkins awakened, and
called cheerily to the boys:</p>

<p>“Come, it’s time to turn out if we want to get back
without running the risk of losing our way. When the
sun gets behind the trees we shall be all at sea so far as
direction goes.”</p>

<p>The short nap had refreshed the boys wonderfully,
and they were on their feet at once, ready for the tramp.</p>

<p>“Father will laugh when we tell him that, after being<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
on shore so long, we haven’t seen the kind of a tree we
were searching for.”</p>

<p>“You may have better luck to-morrow,” the mate said,
cheerily, as he led the return march, and the little party
traveled so rapidly that in a trifle more than an hour they
were pulling toward the <em>Day Dream</em> from the cove, all
unconscious of the half-a-dozen black forms concealed in
the thicket near the water’s edge watching their every
movement.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A STRANGE SPECTACLE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Although Andy had paid no attention to the departure
of the boys and the mate, he was watching eagerly for
their return, and Gil said, laughingly, as he saw the old
darky’s woolly pate just outside the forward companionway
hatch:</p>

<p>“I suppose he thought we would never come back; that
the voudoos were sure to catch us. We must ask him
how it is he feels secure now, when a short time ago he
was confident we should not live to get home again.”</p>

<p>“He has probably conjured up some kind of a charm,”
the mate replied, as he leaped aboard the yacht, painter
in hand, and at that instant the cook disappeared very
suddenly.</p>

<p>Captain Mansfield was taking his ease under the awning
aft when the boys came over the rail, and from the
expression on their faces he knew the forenoon’s work
had produced no satisfactory results.</p>

<p>“Treasure-hunting in such a climate isn’t what it is
cracked up to be, eh?” he cried.</p>

<p>“We haven’t found what we wanted yet, but we may
be more successful to-morrow,” Gil said, just a trifle
sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Take your time about it, but let me know when you<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
begin to grow discouraged, for this isn’t the safest
anchorage I have seen, in case the wind comes from any
northerly quarter.”</p>

<p>It really seemed as if Mr. Jenkins had been seized with
an attack of the treasure-hunting fever, for, without waiting
to eat dinner, which was already prepared, he produced
his glass and began searching the thicket.</p>

<p>“Are you looking for an old tree?” Nelse asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; we may as well get our bearings at once, and
save just so much time to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Do you see any?”</p>

<p>“No less than three. I’ll mark out a course to each,
and neither of them are so far from the shore but that
we can visit all in half a day.”</p>

<p>At this moment Andy came from the galley on his way
to the after pantry, and, motioning to Gil to do the same,
Nelse followed him.</p>

<p>“Well, you see we went on shore and escaped being
devoured by the voudoos,” he said, when all three entered
the cabin.</p>

<p>“Don’t say nuffin ’bout it, honey,” the cook whispered,
imploringly. “Dis yere schooner ain’t outer de reach ob
dem debbils till she’s boun’ home.”</p>

<p>“Tell us what you did to protect yourself?” Gil asked.
“We tried to get into the galley last night in order to
learn the same thing, but you wouldn’t open the door.”</p>

<p>“You’se crazy, chile, ter tork so loud when we’se in dis
yere place. I couldn’t tole yer nuffin ’bout it, kase den
de charm would spile. Ef yer don’ go ashore ag’in there’s
er chance ob gittin’ off wid our lives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>“Then it is a charm you’ve got!” Nelse cried, gleefully.
“Let us see it, Andy.”</p>

<p>“I’se done gone ’bliged to keep cl’ar ob you chillun ef
dar’s any mo’ said ’bout it,” the cook replied, angrily.
“We’se in a mighty bad scrape, an’ I’se got my han’s full
takin’ keer ob Andy Storts widout tryin’ fur ter bring mo’
trubble by torkin’.”</p>

<p>This ended the conversation, so far as the old darky
was concerned, for, after placing certain additional dishes
on the table, he betook himself to the seclusion of his
galley.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins could apparently think of nothing but the
supposed treasure, and during a greater portion of the
remainder of the day he pored over the rude chart, discussing
with the boys the possibility that it might refer
to some other island.</p>

<p>Andy took great pains to stay out of the way all this
time, and they saw nothing of him until supper was
served; but even then he refused to speak.</p>

<p>That evening Gil and Nelse slung hammocks under the
awning, intending to sleep on deck because of the excessive
heat which rendered the cabin suffocatingly close,
and the mate ensconced himself in a folding-chair which
could be stretched out in the semblance of a bed.</p>

<p>It was nine o’clock. Save for the low, musical murmur
of the sea on the sandy beach, not a sound could be
heard, and the boys were fast sinking into the arms of the
dream-god when Mr. Jenkins whispered, excitedly:</p>

<p>“Look there! I reckon there’s considerable in Andy’s
yarn about voudoos.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>This was sufficient to cause the boys to leap from
their hammocks very suddenly, and, gazing in the direction
pointed out by the mate they saw nothing more remarkable
than the glow of a fire about half a mile to the
eastward of where they had landed during the forenoon.</p>

<p>“There’s not much startling about that,” Gil said, in a
tone of disappointment.</p>

<p>“It shows there are human beings ashore near here,
although we failed to find any traces of them.”</p>

<p>“But it doesn’t prove that they are other than honest
fishermen or planters,” Nelse added.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” Mr. Jenkins replied, in a musing
tone. “If there was nothing out of the ordinary run going
on over there why should a fire have been built?”</p>

<p>“It won’t take us long to learn,” Gil cried, for his last
remark had aroused his curiosity. “What is to prevent
our rowing over that way? The tender hasn’t been
taken out of the water, and, although we’ve had plenty
of exercise to-day, a little more won’t do us any harm.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you if the captain makes no objection,” the
mate said, as he sprang to his feet, and Gil’s father, who
had overheard the conversation, replied:</p>

<p>“Do as you please, but don’t stay away too long, for at
this season of the year it is impossible to say when a
breeze may spring up which would make our anchorage
a dangerous one.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t likely we shall want to land,” Gil said as he
went to the cabin for his and Nelse’s revolvers, and five
minutes later the little party were rowing toward the reflection<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
of the fire, Gil and Nelse at the oars, and Mr.
Jenkins steering.</p>

<p>“Be careful,” the mate had said, in a low tone, as they
left the side of the yacht. “On such a night as this
sound travels a long distance over the water, and you
don’t want to splash about much.”</p>

<p>This admonition was unnecessary. The thought that
they might be on the brink of some wonderful discovery
rendered both the boys cautious, and he who could hear
anything as the little craft glided toward the shore would
need to have a very acute sense of hearing.</p>

<p>Perhaps half-an-hour elapsed before they were near
that portion of the shore from which the light had been
reflected, and then it was learned that the blaze was
some distance inland.</p>

<p>It was possible to distinguish voices in an unmusical
song or chant, but nothing could be seen, and Mr. Jenkins
whispered:</p>

<p>“We might just as well have stayed on the schooner,
so far as learning anything is concerned. Shall we go
back, or do you boys want to creep up on those fellows?”</p>

<p>It was evident that the mate wished to land, but preferred
to have it appear as if he was doing so simply to
oblige his companions.</p>

<p>“I would like to see what is going on in there,” Nelse
said, and Gil added, after a moment’s thought:</p>

<p>“There can be no harm in trying it. Those who are
making that noise would hardly dare to raise a row in
case we betrayed our whereabouts, and, besides, armed as<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
we are, it should be possible to hold our own against quite
a crowd.”</p>

<p>The boat’s bow was run gently on the sand, and Mr.
Jenkins stepped softly over the side to hold her while
the boys got out, after which she was carried a full length
up on the shore.</p>

<p>“I’ll go ahead,” the mate whispered, “and you take
good care to keep close to me, for it would make a bad
mess if we should get separated in the darkness.”</p>

<p>“Go on; we’ll take care of that part,” Gil whispered,
and the advance was begun slowly, for it was no easy matter
to make one’s way among the dense foliage with the
necessary degree of silence.</p>

<p>As the party advanced the sound of voices became
more distinct, and finally it became positive that some odd
sort of a performance was being given in this wild place.</p>

<p>When about three hundred yards had been traversed
the mate came to a sudden halt, and, as he pulled aside a
cluster of saw palmettos the boys had a full view.</p>

<p>Instinctively they had crouched to the ground when
Mr. Jenkins’ movements told that the journey was ended,
and, screened by the underbrush, it seemed positive they
were hidden from that strange party.</p>

<p>The fire had been built in a small cleared space at the
foot of a huge palm tree, and over the flames was suspended
an iron pot, from which a most disagreeable odor
arose.</p>

<p>For the time being, however, the spectators had no
thought for anything save the actors in this strange spectacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>No less than twenty coal-black men, naked, save for
a cloth about the loins were dancing to and fro near the
blaze, bending their bodies in every possible position, and
making the hideous noise with greatest energy. Now
and then one would circle around the pot several times in
succession, howling yet louder, while his companions remained
silent, and at the end of the dismal song would
throw something into the boiling mass, after which the
uproar increased until another member of the party performed
the same ceremony.</p>

<p>Gil was very positive he saw first a snake and then a
toad thrown into the pot, and it hardly seemed possible
the cooking would be followed by eating.</p>

<p>The faces of the dancers were painted with vivid red
lines, as if the coloring matter was blood, and two of the
eldest members had the same kind of ornamentation covering
their entire bodies.</p>

<p>When the crowd had apparently exhausted themselves
by this sort of exercise, they crouched around the fire,
looking more like gigantic frogs than human beings, and
the old fellows stirred the contents of the pot, making
the most uncouth gestures meanwhile.</p>

<p>Then it appeared as if the “broth” was done.</p>

<p>The performers began to dance and sing once more,
and Gil had just thought that it was time for them to retrace
their steps, when the two highly-decorated performers
set about ladling the disgusting-looking stuff into cocoanut
shells.</p>

<p>A dozen portions were taken from the pot, and handed
to as many men, each of whom immediately started<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
through the thicket in a different direction, one passing
so near Nelse that it seemed as if he leaped directly over
the boy, and the remainder of the crowd redoubled their
howls and contortions.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins pressed the hands of his companions to
intimate that it was time for them to leave, and the boys
rose to their feet, following him at a comparatively swift
pace, to the spot where the boat had been left.</p>

<p>“We must have missed our way somehow,” the mate
whispered, when they finally emerged from the thicket,
and saw no signs of the craft. “I could almost swear
that this is the place where we landed.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” Gil replied, in dismay. “Here is the imprint
of her keel in the sand. Some of those fellows who
left with the soup have stolen her.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN TROUBLE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Not until Mr. Jenkins examined the beach in every direction
for a distance of ten or fifteen yards from where
they came out of the thicket, would he be convinced that
the tender had been stolen.</p>

<p>Then, when he saw the imprints of bare feet, showing
that the thieves had carried the little craft thirty or forty
feet toward the eastward before launching her, and even
found the spot where her bow had rested on the sand,
probably while the negroes got on board, he was almost
beside himself with rage.</p>

<p>“I ought to be kicked every hour in the day until we
get home again,” he said, angrily. “Anybody, except a
fool like me, would have had sense enough, when those
fellows left the fire, to realize that the boat might be in
danger; but I never gave her a thought.”</p>

<p>“Neither did Nelse nor I,” Gil added, “consequently
we rank quite as high in the fool scale. There’s no way
out of it, but admit to father that we allowed the tender
to be stolen, and try to look pleasant when he makes sport
of us.”</p>

<p>“I wish we were where we could tell him,” the mate
said, half to himself.</p>

<p>“That can be easily arranged. It will only be necessary<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
to discharge the revolvers three or four times, and I
guarantee father will send some one ashore to learn if
there is any trouble.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be just safe to do that. The
crowd we saw back there would most likely prove to be
ugly customers, if they had any idea we saw their capers,
and it might not be pleasant to bring them down upon us
by reports of the weapons.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe they are voudoos?” Nelse asked, in a
voice which was not remarkable for its steadiness.</p>

<p>“There can be no question about it.”</p>

<p>“But what are they doing?”</p>

<p>“I reckon old Andy is the only one of our folks who
can answer that question.”</p>

<p>“It begins to look as if we had good cause to be
afraid,” Gil said, gloomily.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” the mate replied, cheerily. “We have
only to loaf around here two or three hours, and then
some one will come ashore to look for us. The most
serious portion of the whole business is that the captain
is bound to haul us over the coals for losing the boat and
putting him to so much trouble.”</p>

<p>Owing to the darkness and the distance, it was not possible
to see even the outlines of the yacht; but the forlorn
party knew in what direction she lay, and they seated
themselves on the sand just outside the fringe of bushes,
straining their ears to hear the first sound which should
tell that friends were coming.</p>

<p>Half an hour elapsed.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins had just ascertained this fact by looking<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
at his watch, when the sound of oars caused all three to
leap to their feet in joy.</p>

<p>Surprise and delight that the time of waiting had
been so short prevented them from noticing that the craft
was coming from a direction opposite the location of the
schooner, and as they went to the water’s edge, Gil
hailed:</p>

<p>“Boat ahoy! Here we are! Our craft was stolen, and
to save ourselves from possible trouble, we didn’t try to
attract your attention.”</p>

<p>Then he paused for a reply; but none came. The light
splashing of water told that the boat was still approaching,
and Mr. Jenkins cried, impatiently:</p>

<p>“Ahoy there! Where are you from?”</p>

<p>Now even the sounds of the oars ceased, and the little
party were so engaged in trying to distinguish the craft
amid the gloom, that they failed to hear the light patter
of naked feet directly behind them.</p>

<p>“It must be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins did not finish the sentence, for at that instant
he was seized from behind and dragged backward on
the sand before he could make the slightest outcry.</p>

<p>Gil and Nelse were served in the same manner at the
same time, and when either of the three realized what had
happened, they were powerless to move or speak.</p>

<p>Two negroes held each of the prisoners as in bonds of
iron, while a third covered the captive’s mouth with an
enormous hand to prevent any outcry.</p>

<p>The mate attempted to show fight; but struggle as he
might, it was impossible to do more than render his own<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
position painful, and this he understood in a very short
time.</p>

<p>The <em>Day Dream’s</em> boat, which had played such an important
part in their capture, was now rowed to the shore,
and from her leaped two other negroes, who, after assuring
themselves that the white strangers had been secured,
lifted the tender from the water, carrying her
straight up from the beach.</p>

<p>When they had disappeared in the thicket, the prisoners
were raised to their feet, and one of the captors, who appeared
to be the leader of the party, spoke harshly in a
tongue which neither the mate nor the boys understood.</p>

<p>From the tone, it was easy to guess that he was warning
them of the consequences in case they should make
any outcry; but this seemed superfluous, in view of the
fact that the black hands were still held firmly over their
mouths.</p>

<p>Half-led, half-dragged, the little party was forced
through the thicket, in the direction from which they had
just come, and not a word was spoken until all were within
the circle of light cast by the fire around which the negroes
had been dancing.</p>

<p>Here the black men held a very lively conversation, all
talking at the same time, and pausing now and then only
to examine more closely the prisoners.</p>

<p>Gil believed they were discussing the question of what
should be done with their prizes, and this seemed yet
more probable when the two highly-decorated old men
spoke at great length, while the others listened, all nodding<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
their heads in token of approval when the speeches
were brought to a close.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Jenkins appeared to be more alarmed
than were the boys; but his fear came from other sources
than the present disagreeable situation.</p>

<p>The soughing of the wind among the trees told, to his
experienced ear, that a breeze was springing up from the
northeast, and if it increased to no more even than what
might be expected at this season of the year, he knew it
would become necessary for the yacht to put to sea, or
run down the other side of the island for a harbor.</p>

<p>In either case they would be left comparatively alone
among those who could be considered in no other light
than as enemies, and the prospect was not cheering.</p>

<p>The negroes had not yet decided what should be done,
when the report of a musket was heard in the distance,
and the prisoners looked at each other meaningly, for
they knew it was a signal for them to return at once.</p>

<p>This noise caused the black men to come to a speedy
conclusion, and after the old fellows had given what were
evidently very minute directions as to future movements,
the fire was extinguished.</p>

<p>The prisoners, guarded as before, were marched
through the thicket on a course nearly at right angles
with the one by which they had come from the beach, and
had not proceeded more than a quarter of a mile when
shouts were heard from the shore.</p>

<p>“Gil! Mr. Jenkins! Shipmates ahoy!”</p>

<p>Captain Mansfield had sent a boat ashore in search of
the missing members of his crew, and one can fancy<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
some portion of the prisoners’ mental distress at knowing
friends were so near and they unable to make their whereabouts
known.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Jenkins attempted to free himself; but after
receiving several warning pricks from the point of a
knife, in token of what might follow in case he persisted
in fighting, he gave up the struggle.</p>

<p>Again and again did the cries come to their ears, borne
on the wind, which was steadily and rapidly increasing,
and then another report of a musket told that this last
boat had been recalled.</p>

<p>Gil and Nelse were almost frantic. Both realized that
the negroes would not have dared to commit such an outrage,
unless they were so strong in numbers as to resist
an attack, and the thought of what might be their fate on
this island, which had already been the scene of so many
bloody dramas, was ample excuse for any display of
weakness or terror.</p>

<p>The negroes marched rapidly on for at least half-an-hour,
and then, coming suddenly, as if from the very
bowels of the earth, a bright flame appeared directly in
front of the leaders.</p>

<p>As their eyes became accustomed to the gloom, the
boys saw that the blaze proceeded from half-a-dozen
torches, held by as many men, who had come out of what
appeared to be a cave in the side of a hill.</p>

<p>Here quite a lengthy conversation ensued, and then the
prisoners were led through a passage sufficiently wide for
three men to walk abreast, to a small cave situated about
fifty feet from the opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>Further on, the glow, as of a fire, could be seen, thus
showing that beyond their halting-place was another and
a larger underground chamber, where, probably, those
who had been performing the uncouth antics near the
beach found a shelter.</p>

<p>The prisoners were thrust into the small cave, or excavation,
without ceremony, and the others went on, apparently
indifferent as to what might be done by the
whites.</p>

<p>The place was so dark that no idea could be formed of
its size, or what it might contain, and even if it had been
light, Mr. Jenkins would hardly have given it any attention
at that moment.</p>

<p>He stood near the entrance watching until the men had
entered the cave at the end of the passage, and then he
ran toward the entrance.</p>

<p>Before he had taken twenty steps, a blow from a club
brought him to his knees, showing that sentinels were on
the alert, and he crawled back, dazed and bleeding from
an ugly cut on the head.</p>

<p>The boys had not followed; but they understood from
the noise what had happened, and, aiding their companion
to enter the underground prison, seated themselves
beside him.</p>

<p>“What a fool I was to fancy we were left unguarded,”
the mate said, as he felt the warm blood trickling down
his face. “Strike a light, Gil, and see what condition my
head is in.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, the boys had a small supply of wax<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
matches, and one of these burned long enough to examine
the wound.</p>

<p>A single glance was sufficient to show that it was not
serious, although it would probably cause considerable
pain, and Nelse tied his handkerchief around it to stay the
flow of blood.</p>

<p>“I hope we shall have a chance to dress it better before
twenty-four hours have passed,” Gil said, with a vain attempt
to speak cheerfully. “Father will surely come on
shore in search of us when the sun rises, and he should
be able to follow such a broad trail as we must have left
in coming here.”</p>

<p>“Your father is at sea by this time,” Mr. Jenkins replied,
almost sharply. “Didn’t you notice that the wind
was blowing half a gale before we arrived here? To
save the yacht, he had to get up anchor, and it may be a
week before he can get back.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE CAVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Neither of the boys had thought that it might become
necessary for the <em>Day Dream</em> to leave her anchorage; but
as the mate spoke, both remembered what Captain Mansfield
said shortly before they left, and the knowledge that
their friends had been forced to abandon them brought
with it the deepest despair.</p>

<p>They could hear the wind, as it swept across the mouth
of the underground passage, and this told plainly that if
the schooner had not left this particular portion of the
coast, she would probably be a wreck before morning.</p>

<p>During a long while the mournful party crouched upon
the damp earth silent, each occupied with his own gloomy
thoughts, and then Gil said, as he arose to his feet:</p>

<p>“We mustn’t give way in this manner! Other people
have been in worse scrapes and come out all right by
keeping a stiff upper lip, and watching for some chance to
help themselves. We are acting like babies.”</p>

<p>“You are right, lad,” and Mr. Jenkins stood erect,
clasping Gil’s hand. “Let’s see what kind of a place we
are in, and then, perhaps, matters won’t appear quite so
desperate. I’d give all the wages due me if I knew why
these black villains have brought us here.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be to kill us, for that could have been done<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
without any trouble when we were on the beach,” Gil
replied.</p>

<p>This remark seemed to give Nelse courage, and he said,
joining the others:</p>

<p>“There’s no use speculating about what can’t be found
out until they choose to tell us. Let’s do as Mr. Jenkins
proposed, and find out where we are. I’ve got a box
full of matches, and they ought to give light enough to
show how the place looks.”</p>

<p>While speaking, he had ignited one of the tapers, and
all three gazed around eagerly.</p>

<p>There was but little to be seen. An excavation, evidently
formed by the hand of man, about twelve feet deep
and eight wide, with nothing in it, save a pile of charred
wood, where a fire had once been built, made up a complete
description of their prison.</p>

<p>“It isn’t the most comfortable-looking place I ever saw,”
Gil said, trying hard to appear cheerful; “but we might
at least kindle a small fire, since the materials are so near
at hand. If our friends make any objection to the plan,
they can’t do much more than put it out.”</p>

<p>A blaze, however small, would be better than the profound
darkness, and the boys raked the fragments of
wood together, partially covering them with sand to prevent
a too rapid consumption of fuel.</p>

<p>It was necessary to use three matches of their now
precious hoard, before the flames fastened upon the blackened
sticks; but the outlay seemed none too great when
the dispiriting gloom was thus partially dispelled.</p>

<p>The one question uppermost in the minds of all was,<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
why they had been made prisoners, and, after gathering
around the fire, this thought would have caused another
painful silence, but for the mate, who said, briskly:</p>

<p>“The darkness will seem all the more intense when this
wood has been burned, and what little we have won’t last
a great while.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we can help ourselves,” Gil replied,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>“I am going out through the passage on a hunt for
more.”</p>

<p>“And get another blow on the head? Tied up as you
are in that handkerchief, which is covered with blood, you
look sufficiently like a pirate without trying to add to
your peculiar beauty.”</p>

<p>“But this time I’ll go toward the big cave, where our
particular friends are probably enjoying themselves.
Light enough comes from there to show if any one is on
guard, and I’ll guarantee that these villains don’t get a
second chance to hit me with a club.”</p>

<p>As if fearing his companions might try to dissuade him
from his purpose, Mr. Jenkins crept on his hands and
knees to where he could have a view of the passage.</p>

<p>While it was impossible to distinguish anything distinctly,
he was able to satisfy himself that there was no
one between the two caves, and he rose to his feet as he
whispered:</p>

<p>“I’m bound to have some idea of what them chaps are
doing, whether I get any more wood or not. Stay here,
and I’ll be back in five minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>“We had rather go with you,” Gil replied, as he approached
the mate.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be safe. If they should happen to see me,
and kick up a row, the passage is so small that the three
of us would get all tangled up. You can watch from
here, and have some idea of what I am doing.”</p>

<p>He started as the last word was spoken, and the boys
could see his form outlined against the faint light until he
reached the entrance to this second chamber, when he apparently
disappeared in the gloom.</p>

<p>“Where has he gone now?” Nelse asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“I reckon he’s simply leaning against the side, out of
the range of the fire, watching those who are inside.”</p>

<p>Gil’s surmise was correct. Jenkins was standing where
he could get a fairly good view of the interior, and that
which he saw caused him mingled feelings of surprise,
bewilderment and fear.</p>

<p>In the cave, which was circular, and about twenty feet
in diameter, were seventeen negroes, seated back against
the wall of earth, thus leaving the greater portion of the
floor space free. Four small fires were burning, as if to
designate the points of the compass, and between these
stood the most repulsive-looking old negro the mate had
ever seen. His wool was gray, and hung in matted locks
nearly to his shoulders. His toothless mouth appeared to
be the focus of a mass of wrinkles so deep as to destroy
all semblance of a face, and gave his head the appearance
of a bag with one end puckered by a drawing-string.</p>

<p>The skin of some animal served as a sort of petticoat
for the old fellow, and around his neck was wound an<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
odd sort of necklace, seemingly composed of small bones,
the ends of which reached nearly to the ground. His feet
were bare, as was the upper portion of his body, and in
each hand he held a long knife, the blade dripping with
blood.</p>

<p>When Jenkins first saw the hideous creature, he was
standing silent and motionless, as if wrapped in deep
thought; but after a few seconds he aroused himself,
began walking around each fire in turn, muttering in guttural
tones, and drawing the blade of the knife across
his chest, causing the blood to flow in tiny streams with
every stroke.</p>

<p>The spectators watched him as if spellbound. No one
so much as moved, and Jenkins could have sworn that
they were literally holding their breath.</p>

<p>Weaving his way in and out among the piles of burning
wood, the old fellow continued to hack and cut at himself
until the entire upper portion of his body was covered
with blood, and then, crouching upon the earth, he
gazed steadily into the flames for several moments.</p>

<p>Jenkins was about to turn away, believing the performance
had come to a close, when the negro sprang to his
feet with a quick, agile movement, and looked around
upon his companions like one just awakening from a
dream.</p>

<p>Now it could be told from the expression on the black
faces that all believed they were about to hear some wonderful
revelation, and after a certain length of time, probably
made as long as possible in order to render his words
the more impressive, the old man began to speak, slowly<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
at first, but increasing in vehemence until it sounded
more like the snarl of an angry animal than the result of
a human voice.</p>

<p>He spoke in a language which Jenkins did not understand,
but, under the circumstances, it was not difficult to
fancy the long harangue had especial reference to the
prisoners.</p>

<p>During at least fifteen minutes he continued in the
most impassioned strain, and then ensued the same scene
the mate had witnessed near the beach.</p>

<p>All present began the apparently meaningless dance
and song around the fires, and Jenkins, thinking he had
seen enough of this mummery, made his way back to
those whom he knew were awaiting his return.</p>

<p>There was no thought of gathering wood as he crept
cautiously through the passage, and when he reached the
place allotted to the prisoners, all was dark and still.</p>

<p>“Are you here, boys?” he asked, in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, you almost stepped on us. What are they doing
over there? We heard the same kind of a chant that attracted
our attention when we landed to begin this foolish
trip which has ended so disastrously.”</p>

<p>“They are cutting those silly capers over again. This
is what I saw.”</p>

<p>Then Jenkins gave a detailed account of all that had
taken place in the chamber, from the time of his arrival,
and when he had finished, Gil asked:</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they are up to?”</p>

<p>“I reckon Andy could tell you, for there can be no
doubt but that these are a lot of voudoo worshipers, and<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
the fellow with the knife must be a priest, or something
of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they could know that we were in
search of pirates’ treasure?” Nelse asked.</p>

<p>“Not unless some of them understand English, and
heard us talking when we came ashore this morning.”</p>

<p>“That might be,” Gil said, half to himself; “but so long
as we hadn’t found any, I can’t imagine why we should
have been made prisoners.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was because we saw them at their dances,”
Nelse suggested.</p>

<p>To Gil this did not seem a very plausible explanation,
but since he could advance nothing better, it was accepted
as the true reason.</p>

<p>“We have got to get out of here somehow,” Mr. Jenkins
said, after a long pause. “They may not intend to
do us any harm, but we won’t take the risk, if it can be
avoided. Toward morning I’m going to make one more
effort to find out how many are on guard at the entrance.
If we could only get hold of our revolvers! I know who
has them, and it is certain he isn’t with the mummers,
therefore he must be outside.”</p>

<p>“With his eyes wide open, to prevent you either from
escaping, or trying to get your own again.”</p>

<p>“We will see about that. We won’t make any move
until nearly morning, therefore it’s a good idea to get
some sleep, if possible. Lie down, and I’ll call you before
daybreak.”</p>

<p>The conditions were not favorable for slumber, but yet
the boys were so tired that in a very short time both were<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
sleeping quietly, and the mate, seated near the entrance to
the excavation, was keeping strict watch, with apparently
not the slightest idea of closing his eyes.</p>

<p>He could hear the discordant chant from the inner
cave, now rising high, and again dying away until it was
lost in the distance, and this was continued so long that,
despite his will, the unconsciousness of sleep came upon
him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A DISCOVERY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>While Mr. Jenkins slept, the fantastical worship in the
inner cave was brought to a close; the party separated,
each man going in a different direction across the island,
as if to ascertain the general condition of affairs, and before
they were reunited, the sun had risen.</p>

<p>The wind continued from the same quarter with unabated
fury, and one needed only to see the trees bending
before the blast to understand that the <em>Day Dream</em> could
not come to an anchorage near that portion of the coast
for some time to come.</p>

<p>The prisoners were not disturbed until nearly two hours
after daybreak, and then the mate was brought to his feet
very suddenly by a vicious kick from a burly negro, who
had evidently been selected to act the part of guard.</p>

<p>Just for an instant Jenkins was disposed to show fight;
but before he could do anything so rash, the thought of
the consequences prevented him from raising his hands.</p>

<p>The situation was sufficiently grave without his making
it worse by a useless show of resistance.</p>

<p>“Get up, lads!” he cried, wishing to arouse his companions
before the brutal guard could deal them a blow,
and the boys sprang to their feet instantly, not understanding
where they were for several seconds, and then,<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
as the unpleasant truth came slowly back to them, Gil
asked:</p>

<p>“What’s going on now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, my boy; but this dark-complexioned
gentleman has been trying his toes on my ribs in such
an energetic fashion that I fancy we are to make some
kind of a move. Whatever happens, keep close to me,
and don’t provoke the crowd by turning rusty when we’re
where we can’t help ourselves.”</p>

<p>“How is the weather?” Nelse asked.</p>

<p>“About the same as when we arrived here. There’s no
chance of seeing the yacht to-day.”</p>

<p>This brief conversation was interrupted by the remainder
of the black party, who now came from the outside,
and the prisoners were made to understand by signs
that they were to leave the cave.</p>

<p>With the boys on either side of him, Jenkins marched
out, the huge black walking close behind the three, and the
others clustered around in a manner which precluded any
possibility of an escape.</p>

<p>The captors were evidently making their way back to
the sea once more, and to both Gil and Nelse this fact was
in some slight degree pleasing, since it seemed to bring
them nearer the <em>Day Dream</em>.</p>

<p>“How is your head?” Gil asked, when they had walked
a short distance in silence.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t feel particularly comfortable; but I reckon
it’ll be all right after a while.”</p>

<p>“If we could bathe it, you would look better. That<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
bloody handkerchief and the matted hair gives you the
appearance of a veritable pirate.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel like one, at all events,” Mr. Jenkins replied,
with a laugh. “Just now I’m more of a cannibal
than anything else, for it seems as if I could eat a donkey
and then look over my shoulder for the rider.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they intend to starve us?”</p>

<p>“That’s a hard question to answer. It isn’t likely
they’ll take any too good care of us, and we stand a
chance of going hungry for some time to come.”</p>

<p>“Such a thing wouldn’t trouble me, providing I could
see a way out of this scrape,” Nelse said, with a long-drawn
sigh. “If the yacht can’t come to an anchor while
the wind is so strong, we needn’t expect help to-day.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be a change in the weather when the sun
sets,” the mate replied, encouragingly; but at the same
time he did not believe his own statement.</p>

<p>The very old negro was evidently the chief of the
party, and he led them through a narrow path, cut amid
the dense tangle of foliage, until they arrived at the very
spot where the prisoners had witnessed the dance around
the pot while hidden among the trees.</p>

<p>Here they were met by the two aged and highly-decorated
blacks, who had acted as masters of the ceremony
on the previous evening.</p>

<p>All the repulsive-looking crowd evidently understood
that they were in no immediate danger of being hunted
out by those interested in the prisoners, for they moved
with the utmost deliberation.</p>

<p>“The scoundrels know our shipmates can’t get here to-day,<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
and are going to make the most out of the performance,
whatever it may be,” Jenkins said, angrily, as two
of the men began to lash him securely to a tree in such a
manner that he could do no more than turn his head from
side to side.</p>

<p>The boys were fastened in the same fashion, and so
near together that it was possible for them to hear each
other when speaking in a low tone of voice.</p>

<p>After the prisoners were thus disposed of, the blacks
began to prepare breakfast by roasting over a bed of coals
fifteen or twenty small animals, which resembled rabbits,
the three leaders retiring to the depths of the thicket as
if for consultation while this work was being done.</p>

<p>The cooks had not even taken the trouble to dress the
game; but the odor of the roasting flesh was so appetizing,
and the prisoners were so hungry, that all three
waited with the liveliest impatience for the meal to be
made ready.</p>

<p>“I’m certain I can eat a whole rabbit; but I don’t suppose
we’ll be allowed to have as much as we want,” Nelse
said, watching the operations eagerly.</p>

<p>“We had better not count on regularly filling ourselves
up,” Jenkins replied, grimly, as a very unpleasant suspicion
began to creep into his mind.</p>

<p>When the feast was prepared, the old men were summoned,
the remainder of the party standing at a respectful
distance until they had satisfied their hunger, and then
all hands set about devouring the food in a literally savage
fashion.</p>

<p>Holding it in their hands and smearing themselves with<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
fat and blood, until their black faces looked even more
hideous than before, the men gorged themselves, crunching
the smaller bones as dogs would have done, and only
when the last morsel had disappeared did they cease.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the prisoners could do no more than gaze
at the revolting spectacle, which, fortunately, partially
caused them to forget their hunger, and not a word was
spoken until Jenkins, seeing that his companions were
rapidly giving way to despair, tried to arouse them.</p>

<p>“It’s no very great hardship to go hungry for twenty-four,
or even forty-eight hours,” he said, cheerily. “If
we think of eating, it’ll only make matters worse, so let’s
sheer off on some other tack.”</p>

<p>“That is not so easily done,” Nelse replied, gloomily.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about it. Look around and see what an
odd sort of a forest this is, compared to such as we have
at home.”</p>

<p>“We’ve had time to be pretty well acquainted with it
since landing yesterday. There doesn’t seem to be anything
strange here, except it is the big palm tree near
where the old scoundrels are sitting. That&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Gil would have started to his feet in surprise, had it
not been for the bonds, as he cried:</p>

<p>“It is the very tree we were hunting for! There are
none others as tall, and it’s surely old enough to have
served as a landmark when our chart was made.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are right, my boy,” the mate said, after
a short pause. “It would be strange if these villains
have shown us just what we wanted to find.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see that it will do us any good, even if we<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
knew a big pile of gold was absolutely buried in the immediate
vicinity,” Nelse replied, grumblingly; but at the
same time he continued to gaze at the palm, and it could
be seen that, for the moment, the pangs of hunger were
forgotten.</p>

<p>The possibility of their having finally arrived at the desired
place, through no inclination or volition of their
own, was sufficient to furnish them with a fruitful topic
of conversation, and but little attention was paid to the
blacks until the departure of several of the younger men
caused Gil to ask:</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose they are going?”</p>

<p>“Most likely to watch out for the yacht. It isn’t certain
your father won’t make an attempt to put in here in
search of us, although I don’t think one of our boats could
land, and they want to make sure of not being interrupted.”</p>

<p>During the next half-hour the negroes remained idle,
lounging near the scene of the feast, and then the messengers
returned.</p>

<p>Whatever report they made must have been satisfactory,
for immediately the fire was rebuilt, the pot slung on
two crotched sticks, and the old fellows took up their station
nearby, as if to repeat the mummery of the previous
evening.</p>

<p>Now the prisoners understood that they were to take
some part in the ceremony, for three of the men stood
directly in front of them, while the priests began once
more the doleful chant.</p>

<p>“They are going to kill us,” Nelse cried, in alarm, but<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
forced to remain motionless before the blacks, each of
whom held a short-bladed knife in his hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins no longer attempted to cheer his companions.
He believed, as Nelse did, and with good
reason.</p>

<p>While the old men sang, those who had evidently been
selected as executioners advanced slowly, brandishing
their weapons, and making gestures, while the remainder
of the party stood nearby, gazing intently, as if at some
fascinating spectacle.</p>

<p>Neither of the prisoners spoke. Death seemed so close
at hand that the numbness of despair was upon them, and
each watched the gleaming circles of steel as the knives
came slowly toward them.</p>

<p>When the three men were not more than five feet away
from him, Gil fancied he heard a slight noise directly in
the rear, as if some one was lighting a match; but since
none of the blacks paid any attention to it, he fancied he
was mistaken, and tried to prepare himself in some slight
degree for the supreme moment.</p>

<p>Now the circle of spectators grew smaller; the old men
forced their way through, that they also might witness
what was possibly one of their fiendish rites, and the
gleaming steel almost touched the victims.</p>

<p>The two boys closed their eyes that they should not see
the deadly blow when it was delivered, and Jenkins believed
he had not many seconds to live, when a singular,
hissing noise was heard directly behind the helpless ones.</p>

<p>Instantly it seemed that a shaft of fire came from the
foliage, with a scream as of some living creature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>Opening their eyes suddenly, the boys saw this thing
of flame tear its way through the crowd, throwing sparks
right and left, and striking two of the blacks with sufficient
force to hurl them to the ground.</p>

<p>The negroes fled with loud yells of terror, as the
“thing,” apparently caught by the foliage, continued to
send forth showers of flame, and before the last man disappeared,
both Gil and Nelse had fainted.</p>

<p>The strain upon them had been too great, and over-taxed
nature gave way beneath it.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">ANDY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>At this particular time Jenkins paid but little attention
to the boys. He fancied the sudden appearance of the
stream of fire was simply a portion of the horrible ceremonies,
and believed the negroes’ terror to be only
simulated.</p>

<p>When the last black disappeared in the foliage, a noise
directly behind him caused him to look for their return
from that quarter, and his surprise can be better imagined
than described when he saw Andy standing in front of
him, his wide mouth open to its fullest extent in silent
enjoyment of the complete rout.</p>

<p>“Where in the name of all that’s wonderful did you
come from?” he cried, and would have followed this with
other questions, had not the cook whispered hurriedly:</p>

<p>“Dere ain’t no time ter tork now, kase we’s boun’ ter be
outer dis yere place before dem debbils cum back. Don’
speak a word.”</p>

<p>With remarkable celerity, Andy cut the bonds of vines,
and while Jenkins was rubbing his arms and legs to restore
the circulation, the cook released the boys.</p>

<p>It was as if the sudden change of position served to restore
them to consciousness, and by the time the cook
had made his arrangements for flight, they were aware of
the rescue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>Gil would have followed Jenkins’ example, and overwhelmed
the negro with questions; but the mate whispered:</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, now; we can hear all about it later.”</p>

<p>Andy’s first care was to gather up the rope-like vines
and throw them on the fire, after which he ran into the
thicket, returning a few seconds later with a large package
wrapped in sailcloth.</p>

<p>“I’se gwine erhead, an’ you’se mus’ cum erlong mighty
fas’ ef yer don’ wan’ ter see dem imps ergin.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, he started toward the
coast to the westward, running so rapidly, laden though
he was, that the others had quite as much as they could do
to keep pace with him.</p>

<p>During fully half an hour the flight was continued, and
just when Nelse was on the point of saying that he could
hold out no longer, however great might be the danger,
Andy halted in the midst of a palmetto thicket.</p>

<p>“We’se gwine ter stay hyar fur erwhile,” he said, speaking
with difficulty, because of his heavy breathing; “but
dere mus’ be a mighty snug watch kept, kase dem debbils
are boun’ ter fin’ out wha’s been ergoin’ on.”</p>

<p>“Tell us how you happen to be here, and where the
yacht is?” Gil asked, as soon as it was possible to speak.</p>

<p>Andy’s story, interspersed as it was with threats
against and commentaries upon the voudoos, would require
too great a space to be related in his own words;
but the substance was as follows:</p>

<p>After the boat had returned to the yacht, and the sailors
reported they could find no trace of the missing ones,<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
Captain Mansfield was utterly at a loss to account for the
singular disappearance. He knew there were no wild
beasts on the island that could have attacked and killed
the entire party, therefore it seemed positive the mate and
the boys were detained by human beings.</p>

<p>To search for them in the darkness would have been
useless, therefore he intended to wait until morning, when
he proposed going on shore himself; but the coming of
the gale prevented this plan from being carried into effect.</p>

<p>It was absolutely necessary the yacht should be gotten
under way, and, in the absence of the mate, equally essential
for the safety of all on board, that the captain should
remain in command.</p>

<p>Knowing they might be obliged to remain away two or
three days, and distressed at the thought of leaving the
missing ones to the mercy of those who had probably captured
them, Captain Mansfield called for some of the
crew to volunteer to go on shore and prosecute a search
during his absence.</p>

<p>None of the sailors cared to venture, and then it was
that Andy offered his services, which were accepted the
more eagerly because of all on board, he could probably
accomplish more, owing to the partial acquaintance he
had with the natives of this and the adjoining islands.</p>

<p>He took a small amount of food with him, and, in addition,
a number of signal rockets with which to make his
whereabouts known as soon as it should be possible for
the yacht to come in shore again. A revolver and a dozen
cartridges, together with a canteen of water, made up the
full list of his stores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[128]</span></p>

<p>It was only after the greatest difficulty that the sailors
succeeded in setting him ashore, for the sea began to run
high immediately the wind sprang up, and he remained
in the thicket near the beach until sunrise, when, almost
before he was ready to commence the search, the voudoos’
chant told him where the prisoners were likely to be
found.</p>

<p>Creeping cautiously up to where a view of the party
could be had, he realized that it would be the height of
folly to make an attack single-handed, and remained inactive,
fully believing the prisoners were to be killed,
until he chanced to think of the signal rockets.</p>

<p>It was a poor experiment upon which to depend as a
means of saving the lives of three people; but, fortunately,
it succeeded admirably, and there was no question but
that the blacks fancied the sparks of fire had been produced
by some supernatural agency.</p>

<p>“How did it happen that you dared venture on shore?”
Gil asked, when the story was ended. “You said nothing
could tempt you to run the risk of meeting the voudoos,
and there can be no mistake about the men who
came so near killing us.”</p>

<p>“I’se dun gone got er charm, an’ when de sailors
wouldn’t cum ershore, dere was nuffin lef’ but fur me ter
do my level bes’.”</p>

<p>“And it couldn’t be improved upon,” Jenkins said, as
he patted the old fellow’s woolly head.</p>

<p>“It was mos’ly de charm,” Andy replied, modestly.</p>

<p>“That had precious little to do with it,” the mate said,<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
emphatically. “The rocket and the man behind it did the
business, and a thousand charms wouldn’t have frightened
those villains away so quickly.”</p>

<p>“What made you spend so much time burning the vines
with which we were tied?” Nelse asked. “They couldn’t
have been used again.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’ erfeared ob dat, honey; but we wanter make
dem debbils t’ink dat de ghostes dun took you off, ropes
an’ all.”</p>

<p>“And it was a good idea, Andy,” Jenkins said. “Now,
if we can only keep them at a proper distance until the
yacht heaves in sight, we shall be all right.”</p>

<p>“I’se gwine ter dribe de whole bilin’ offer dis yere island,”
the old man said, decidedly, much as if he was
proposing a very simple piece of business.</p>

<p>“How do you count on doing that?” Gil asked. “You
said they could do no end of mischief, even when hundreds
of miles away?”</p>

<p>“I’se got de charm, honey, an’ I’se got de rockets. Ef
we kin creep up on ’em once, I’ll start annudder fiery
sarpent what’ll make de voudoos t’ink de las’ day hab
cum.”</p>

<p>“If that could be done, we would have a chance to find
out whether the pirates’ treasure is hidden near the old
palm tree,” Nelse cried, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Now, honey, don’ you’se go ter speckerlatin’ erbout
dat any mo’. It’s wha’s got us all in dis yere trubble, an
we’se gwine ter keep clear ob it, ef I’se got a vote in de
bizness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>“There’s plenty of time to talk about that,” Jenkins interrupted.
“The villains are here yet; it isn’t any sure
thing they can be frightened away, and while they remain,
we shan’t be able to do much of anything but keep
ourselves out of sight.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it about time we thought of eating something?”
Nelse asked, suddenly. “Andy said he brought food from
the yacht, and I would like to have a bite.”</p>

<p>“Take it all, honey, de ole man ain’ wantin’ any now,”
and the cook unstrapped a well-filled haversack from his
shoulders. “I’se had what’ll do me fur de nex’ four
days.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make an equal division whether there is any
chance of your growing hungry or not,” Gil said, as he
began to distribute the food. “It is necessary that we
husband it as much as possible, unless we can count on
seeing father pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“He won’t be able to make this portion of the coast
until the wind blows itself out,” the mate replied, “and
I advise that we go on short rations to-day.”</p>

<p>This remark was hardly necessary, since the amount of
provisions Andy had brought did not suffice to make one
satisfactory meal for the party, and every crumb was devoured
before the hunger of either was more than half
satisfied.</p>

<p>When the haversack of canvas had been emptied, the
cook said, as he examined the wound on Jenkins’ head:</p>

<p>“I’se gwine ter fix yer up a little, Marse Jenkins, an’
den we’d better light out ob dis yere place, kase dere’s no<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
tellin’ when dat crowd’s cumin’ back ter see wha’ made de
sparks fly.”</p>

<p>The mate would have objected to Andy’s spending any
time on what he considered a trifling matter; but the cook
did not wait for remonstrances. Using the water in the
canteen, regardless of whether his companions were
thirsty, he first bathed the wound, and then bandaged it
properly with strips torn from Gil’s shirt, after which he
said, with an air of pride:</p>

<p>“I ’lows you’se gwine ter git ober dat little scratch widout
much trouble, an’ ef dere’s no objection, we oughter
keep on till we light on a better place dan dis yere bunch
ob trees.”</p>

<p>After the generalship he had shown, there was no reason
why the cook should not take command of the party,
and he assumed the leadership by setting out at a rapid
pace toward the coast, the others following close behind
him.</p>

<p>Not until they were within sight of the sea at a point
two or three miles from where the boys and the mate
were made prisoners did he halt, and then it was to say:</p>

<p>“I’se gwine ter skurmish roun’ fur ter see whar dem
debbils am hidin’.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t we go with you?” the mate asked.</p>

<p>“Kase dere’s no tellin’ how de charm’s gwine ter work
fur all han’s, an’ de res’ ob de crowd had better stay hyar
till de ole man gits back.”</p>

<p>“The boys can take care of themselves for a while, and
I’ll keep you company,” Jenkins said, decidedly. “We
can’t afford to run the chance of an accident just now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p>Andy did not fancy being obliged to take a protector
with him; but the mate was determined to share all the
danger, and the two plunged into the thicket, after impressing
upon Gil and Nelse the necessity of remaining
hidden during their absence.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A SUCCESSFUL SCHEME.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When the mate and cook started out to ascertain the
whereabouts of the natives, the former carried the revolver,
and the latter had strapped to his back the bundle of
signal rockets.</p>

<p>At the time their only idea was to learn what the
blacks were doing, and to that end Andy led the way back
toward the cave, circling around in such a manner as
would permit an approach from the south.</p>

<p>After traveling at a rapid pace for twenty minutes or
more, the cook came to a halt, exclaiming as he did so:</p>

<p>“Dere’s no use tuckerin’ our legs all out at de start,
kase dere’s plenty ob time.”</p>

<p>“How is it that you know this island so well? You
move around as if you had always lived here.”</p>

<p>Andy tried to evade the question by speaking of the
weather and the possibility that the yacht could approach
the northern coast by the following morning; but Jenkins
insisted on an answer, and finally the old fellow said:</p>

<p>“I mought jes’ as well tell de trufe; but I don’ hanker
after habin’ de capt’in know erbout it.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever taken a hand in this voudoo business?”
Jenkins asked, sternly, as he watched the old man’s face
closely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>“Nebber! Nebber! I’se done gone bin in a good
many scrapes, but nuffin like dat. Six or ten years ago,
when I was young an’ flighty like, annuder colored man
an’ me runned away frum a brig what we’d shipped in,
an’ hid hyar. De voudoos cum mighty nigh killin’ us
erfore we got took off, an’ dat’s how I’se sich a pertic’lar
’quaintance wid de island.”</p>

<p>“Then you have seen these fellows before?”</p>

<p>“Ef dey ain’ jes’ de same, dey looks a drefful sight like
em.”</p>

<p>“And you knew where the cave was before I said anything
about it?”</p>

<p>“’Deed I didn’t, fo’ a fac’. I nebber seen it; but I
reckon it was ’cause we kept mighty near de beach all de
time watchin’ fur a vessel.”</p>

<p>“What did you find to eat?”</p>

<p>“Dere’s plenty ob oysters ’roun’ de shore, an’ it’s a
prime place fur turtles. Dere ain’t no danger ob goin’
hungry ef de <em>Day Dream</em> don’ come back fur a week.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear that, for the yacht may be away some
time&mdash;I don’t see any signs that this wind will haul around
very soon&mdash;and the food supply promises to become serious
to us. If you are rested, let’s push on; the boys may
grow frightened if we stay too long.”</p>

<p>Andy acted upon this suggestion at once, and the two
did not halt again until they had reached a point from
which a view of the entrance to the cave could be had,
while they were screened by the foliage.</p>

<p>From the first glance it appeared as if the blacks had
not returned to their underground hiding-place; but after<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
waiting five minutes, a woolly head was seen at the entrance
for an instant, and then drawn back very quickly,
as if its owner did not dare to expose any portion of his
precious body very long at a time.</p>

<p>“I’se gwine ter plump one ob dese yere rockets right
inter dat hole,” Andy whispered, as he began to unwrap
the package.</p>

<p>“Don’t do anything so foolish,” the mate replied in the
same cautious tone. “They would then see the stick, and
know it wasn’t the work of supernatural beings. Besides,
we can use them to better advantage by waiting
until the whole gang come outside.”</p>

<p>“Wha’ you’se mean by dat?”</p>

<p>“Some of them have still got the revolvers taken from
the boys an’ me. If we could manage to put our hands
on them it wouldn’t be much of a job to hold the crowd
in check for as long as we wanted to stay.”</p>

<p>“But how’s we gwine ter do dat wid de rockets?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; we’ll wait a while, and perhaps something
may turn up in our favor.”</p>

<p>Andy was eager to continue his work of terrifying the
blacks, but he managed to restrain his impatience, as
Jenkins requested, and during the next hour the two remained
silent and almost motionless, watching intently
for the appearance of their enemies.</p>

<p>During this time two or three of the party had peeped
out several times, without showing any more of their
bodies than was absolutely necessary, and Andy had begun
to grumble because of the delay, when the entire
crowd emerged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[136]</span></p>

<p>They were walking in couples, with the old fellows, who
had put on a yet larger supply of paint, leading the way,
and, from the look of anxiety on their faces, it was plainly
seen that even the alleged priests felt very uncomfortable
in mind.</p>

<p>Andy held one of the rockets at such an angle as would
send it in the midst of the party when it was fired, resting
the base against a tree to avoid the recoil; but Jenkins
prevented him from lighting the match until the crowd
were a dozen yards beyond the entrance to the cave.</p>

<p>“Now give me your revolver,” the mate whispered,
“and be sure to take good aim. If you miss, all that has
been done will be wasted.”</p>

<p>The old darky, probably remembering when he had
been chased by this or a similar gang, <a id="B_136" href="#Ref_136">adjusted the rocket
very carefully, and then ignited the fuse</a>. At the same
instant Jenkins discharged every barrel of the revolver,
aiming low to avoid killing any outright, and this portion
of the scheme was a perfect success.</p>

<div id="Ref_136" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i181.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“Andy adjusted the rocket and ignited the fuse.” <a href="#B_136">See page 136</a>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The rocket plowed its way through the entire line from
the rear, as if it had come out of the cave, and no less
than five were thrown to the ground, while it could be
seen that two of the others had received the attention of
bullets.</p>

<p>Those who were uninjured fled at the utmost speed into
the thicket, screaming with terror, and heeding not the
cries of their companions, who were begging for assistance.</p>

<p>The leaders yelled louder than their followers, and<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
thought only of their own safety, while all hands dropped
everything which might impede their flight.</p>

<p>In the foliage a short distance from where the overturned
ones were lying, the rocket, caught among the
branches, hissed and sparkled, causing the most intense
desire on the part of those remaining to leave that particular
portion of the island as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>While scrambling to their feet they did not cease to
scream at the full strength of their lungs, and once they
were in a condition to run, every man sought the shelter
of the bushes.</p>

<p>“Now is our time,” Jenkins said, hurriedly. “You
rush out there and hunt for the weapons&mdash;I fancy some
of them were dropped during the scramble&mdash;while I see
what there is in the cave that we might want.”</p>

<p>Andy ran like a deer in one direction, while Jenkins
went in another, and five minutes later the two returned
laden with the spoils.</p>

<p>The old darky brought into the thicket two revolvers
with one ammunition belt, four freshly-killed animals,
such as the blacks had roasted for breakfast, and three
murderous-looking knives.</p>

<p>Jenkins found two knives, a couple of hatchets, a small
bag filled with yams, and a spade, he saying, as he held
up the last-mentioned implement for Andy’s inspection:</p>

<p>“I don’t know what we want of such a thing, but I was
determined to bring away as much as possible, and it may
come in handy before we leave.”</p>

<p>“We’se boun’ ter make ’em pay fur de rockets, an’ de
spade will count on de bill. Hadn’ we better mosey<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
’long to de boys? Dey’ll be erbout wild ef we don’ cum
mighty soon.”</p>

<p>“Lead the way, and I’ll follow; but be careful, for it
won’t do to let those fellows have a glimpse of us.”</p>

<p>Andy understood only too well that their safety depended
upon remaining under cover, and he conducted
the mate back to the place where the boys had been left,
by a circuitous route toward the east.</p>

<p>“I’se ’lowin’ dat dem debbils hab all gone ober to the
souf shore, kase it’s frum dere dey kin strike across to de
big island, so all we has ter do is keep on our end, ef we
don’ wan’ ter see ’em.”</p>

<p>When the two were with the boys again nearly five
hours had elapsed since the time of their departure, and
both Gil and Nelse were decidedly disturbed in mind.</p>

<p>“I had just decided that we ought to go out in search
of you,” the former said, as the cook and Jenkins threw
themselves on the ground nearly exhausted by the long,
rapid tramp.</p>

<p>“That would have been a foolish proceeding, even if
we had got into trouble,” the mate said, with a laugh.
“If the scoundrels could down us, it is safe to say you’d
hardly been able to render any assistance. It’s all right,
though, an’ we can count on being left to ourselves until
morning at the earliest.”</p>

<p>Then Jenkins told the boys of what had been done, and
once more Nelse and Gil began to have hopes that a
search might be made for the supposed treasure.</p>

<p>“Can we have something to eat now?” Nelse asked.</p>

<p>“Wait till dark, honey, an’ den I’se gwine ter git up a<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
reg’lar jubelee feast. We kin build a fire, an’ dey can’t
see de smoke.”</p>

<p>“The flames will show more plainly.”</p>

<p>“Dey won’t, kase I’se de boy what knows how ter fix
sich t’ings.”</p>

<p>They were well aware that Andy understood best what
should be done, and both tried to wait patiently until the
time when their hunger could be appeased without too
great danger.</p>

<p>When the sun set the strength of the wind seemed to
increase, and Jenkins stated as his opinion that another
twenty-four hours must elapse before the yacht could be
brought to the old anchorage.</p>

<p>“It don’t make so much difference, now that the blacks
are frightened, and we can defend ourselves in reasonably
good shape,” he said, cheerily. “Unless they contrive to
surprise us, I’ll answer for it that we will hold our own
against twice the number.”</p>

<p>“At the same time I’d rather be on board the yacht until
we know they have left the island,” Nelse said, with a
feeble attempt at a smile.</p>

<p>“So had I; but since it is necessary to wait, we might
just as well look on the bright side of the affair. How
long before you are going to dish up some of those rabbits,
Andy?”</p>

<p>“I’se ready ter make a start now, an’ dat spade is gwine
ter come in mighty handy. Ef you’ll dig a hole, I’ll
mosey ’roun’ fur wood.”</p>

<p>It was dark, not so much as a star appearing in the inky
blackness of the clouds, and the little party could safely<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
move to and fro at will, provided they were careful not to
make a noise.</p>

<p>All hands assisted the cook, whose fireplace was so far
beneath the surface that the flames could easily be
screened from view by bushes, and never had the boys
sat down to a more thoroughly enjoyable meal than this
one of roasted rabbits&mdash;more properly speaking, agoutis&mdash;and
yams.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">TREASURE HUNTING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In this world, when one desire has been satisfied another
springs up, as the boys learned after eating a hearty
supper, for as soon as their hunger was appeased both felt
the necessity of slumber.</p>

<p>“It seems as if I hadn’t been to sleep for a week,” Nelse
said, with a yawn, as he stretched himself out at full
length where the bushes would screen him from the wind.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to prevent your getting all you want
now,” the mate replied. “So scoop in a full supply.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it is necessary to stand watch?” Gil
asked.</p>

<p>“Andy and I will attend to that business.”</p>

<p>“But we ought to do our share.”</p>

<p>“If we are here to-morrow night, you shall take your
turn at it; but just at this time it is important to keep a
sharp lookout, and, tired as you boys are, I wouldn’t like
to trust the matter in your hands.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid of our going to sleep when it
is necessary to keep awake.”</p>

<p>“There are some things a fellow can’t prevent, no matter
how good his intentions may be, so we won’t waste
any more time in a discussion.”</p>

<p>Jenkins spoke in such a decided tone that the boys understood<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
it would be useless to continue the conversation,
and in a very few moments both were sleeping soundly,
while the mate and Andy stood most vigilant guard.</p>

<p>Several times during the night the rustling of the
leaves or soughing of the wind caused the watchers to
make short excursions from the camping-place to learn if
the enemy were in the vicinity; but nothing of an alarming
nature was discovered, and when Gil and Nelse
awakened the general condition of affairs was such as to
give them renewed courage.</p>

<p>The windstorm had cleared away, the sun was shining
brightly in an unclouded sky, and the morning breeze
was sufficiently strong to admit of the yacht’s working her
way up the coast.</p>

<p>“Father should be here before sunset!” cried Gil, as he
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“You are right, my boy,” the mate said, cheerily. “I
allow that she’ll be at the old anchorage, if the breeze
holds, before three o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of the voudoos?”</p>

<p>“Not so much as a hair. Andy’s just about starting
off now to learn if they have gone back to the cave.”</p>

<p>The old darky, who was standing near making his
preparations for the journey, did not speak. The expression
on his face told how grave and dangerous he
considered the mission to be, and at such a time he evidently
believed it beneath his dignity to enter into conversation.</p>

<p>The precious rockets he was fastening over his shoulder
were to be used in case of a great emergency, and<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
the boys noticed that he frequently pressed the bosom of
his shirt, as if to assure himself of the safety of some
object.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he has got his charm there,” Nelse whispered
to Gil. “I’ve noticed that he keeps his hand over that
portion of his shirt more than half the time.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make him show it to us when we get on board
the yacht once more.”</p>

<p>“Be careful of yourself,” Jenkins said, in a low tone, as
Andy turned to leave the camping-place. “Don’t use the
rockets unless it is absolutely necessary, and come back
as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Dere ain’ much danger ob my lingerin’ ’roun’ whar
dat crowd is,” the old man replied, as he disappeared
among the foliage.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, I’m going to skirmish for some oysters,”
Jenkins said, when they were alone. “Here is one of the
revolvers, and in case of any trouble, fire two shots; but
don’t expose yourself by leaving this thicket.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t we got enough for breakfast without your
leaving us?” Nelse asked.</p>

<p>“No; our appetites were too good last night for anything
to be left over from the small amount we managed
to get from the niggers. We can&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bress de Lawd!” Andy shouted, in a loud tone, from
a distance, and, as the little party ran in the direction indicated,
they heard him cry:</p>

<p>“De hull bilin’ ob dem debbils am makin’ fur de odder
islan’ as fas’ as dey kin row. De rockets done gone
did it!”<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
Hardly daring to believe the good news, Jenkins and
the boys kept on at full speed until they were at the
beach, where a view of the sea to the westward could be
had, and then their excitement was little less than that
displayed by the old darky.</p>

<p>Far away on the water were three boats, one of them
probably the <em>Day Dream’s</em> tender, loaded with men, who
were working at the oars vigorously, and there was no
longer any question but that their enemies had been
literally frightened away.</p>

<p>“De fiery sarpents was too much for dem!” Andy cried,
triumphantly, as he went through with a series of contortions,
evidently intended as a dance of joy. “We’se
done gone got de hull islan’ fur ourselbes.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t well to show them that we are nothing more
than men,” Jenkins said, as he pulled the old darky into
the thicket. “If they get an idea it was only a trick, we
may have our hands full before the yacht can come up the
coast. The boys and I will go for something to eat, while
you keep them in sight until they land on Hayti. Keep
just inside the thicket so you can’t be seen.”</p>

<p>Andy threw off the burden, for the rockets were useless,
now the blacks had abandoned the island, and
obeyed the order given, while the others went toward the
northern coast, where they would be screened from view
of those in the boats.</p>

<p>Here plenty of shell fish were found, and before the old
darky returned a most appetizing breakfast had been
cooked.</p>

<p>His report was decidedly encouraging. He had seen<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
the blacks land on the adjoining island, and watched the
boats sufficiently long to assure himself that there was no
danger of an immediate return.</p>

<p>“Dey’s done gone runned off fur erwhile,” he said, in
a tone of satisfaction, “an’ we’se gwine ter lebe dis yere
place erfore dey wants ter cum back.”</p>

<p>“Did you see anything of the yacht?” Jenkins asked.</p>

<p>“Not a hooter; I reckon she’s done gone ’round de
udder side ob de islan’, an’ we’se gwine ter see her when
she’s lettin’ go de cable.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re right, Andy, and since there’s nothing
more to fear, we can spend the time as we choose.”</p>

<p>“If that is the case,” Gil said, in a serious tone, “Nelse
and I want to make one search for the treasure.”</p>

<p>All Andy’s fears were aroused at this mention of the
pirates’ gold, as could be told by his face; but he made
no other protest than to say:</p>

<p>“We’se bin in all dis yere trubble jes’ on ’count ob dat,
an’ it stands to reason we oughter lebe it go.”</p>

<p>“But what harm will be done, if we spend the time
while waiting for the yacht in searching for it? When
she arrives we shall go on board, whether anything has
been found or not, and there can surely no trouble come
of that.”</p>

<p>The old darky made no reply, but he shook his head in
an ominous manner while his hand rested on his shirt,
under which the boys believed the famous “charm” was
hidden.</p>

<p>“Have you got the chart?” Jenkins asked.<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
For reply, Gil took the piece of paper and strip of wood
from his jacket, saying, as he handed them to the mate:</p>

<p>“The blacks didn’t think these were of sufficient value
to steal, otherwise we might have been obliged to give up
the search almost before it was begun.”</p>

<p>“An’ dat would er bin a mighty good t’ing,” Andy muttered,
without so much as turning his head.</p>

<p>For at least the twentieth time the mate pored over the
document, and then he said:</p>

<p>“Suppose we have one try for it. That can surely do
no harm, and it will serve to occupy our time while waiting
for the yacht.”</p>

<p>As may be supposed, the boys were more than willing
to act on this suggestion, and Jenkins immediately began
making preparations for moving the small amount of
stores to the place where they had so nearly met their
death.</p>

<p>Andy assisted in the removal, but it could be seen that
he was far from being pleased with the proposition, and
nothing but a wholesome fear of the mate prevented him
from giving words to that which was in his mind.</p>

<p>“I take it that the letters ‘F’ and ‘S’ are the initials of
the man’s name who drew this thing,” Jenkins said, when
they were at the old palm. “We’ll allow that, at all
events, an’ try for the course as marked out&mdash;18&mdash;8
North, and 5 West from the tree.”</p>

<p>“Will you take it in feet or fathoms?” Nelse asked.</p>

<p>“Feet, as a starter, an’ if the yacht hasn’t hove in sight
after we’ve dug at that spot, it won’t do any harm to try
fathoms.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[147]</span></p>

<p>“But without a compass you can’t be positive as to the
direction.”</p>

<p>“It’s so early in the morning that the sun will serve us
for that, I reckon, an’ we can verify the course after your
father comes.”</p>

<p>Andy had thrown himself on the ground in the shade of
the foliage, his hand clutching the mysterious something
under his shirt, as if to show he did not take part in the
dangerous investigation; but the others paid no attention
to him, and Jenkins paced off the supposed distance in the
gravest manner possible.</p>

<p>“I’se boun’ ter warn you dat we’se gwine ter hab
trubble, ef you’se hunts fur de gol’,” Andy said, solemnly.
“Better lebe it alone, an’ wait fur de yacht.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool,” Jenkins replied, petulantly. “We
can’t afford to lose so good a chance as this.”</p>

<p>“Den I ain’ in it,” and the old darky closed his eyes, as
if to shut out even the movements of his companions.</p>

<p>As nearly as he could judge from the position of the
sun, the mate measured the distance, and then designated
the spot where the boys should begin to dig.</p>

<p>“It’s likely to be pretty far down,” he said, as Gil seized
the spade, “an’ we’ll take turns. You boys work till
you’re tired, an’ then I’ll do my trick.”</p>

<p>Gil set about the task in the firm belief that but a few
moments would be necessary to unearth the treasure, and
Nelse watched eagerly every turn of the earth.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes of such exercise under a hot sun was
enough for the treasure hunter, and then his companion<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
relieved him, Jenkins waiting until both should be tired,
when he would wield the spade.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Andy had wandered toward the beach, as
if afraid even to remain in the locality, and just at the
moment when Nelse was ready to give up in favor of the
mate, the old darky shouted:</p>

<p>“Hyar comes two boats, an’ dey looks like de <em>Day
Dream’s</em> tenders!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE WRECK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Andy made this startling announcement the
treasure seekers abandoned their work to run with all
speed to the beach where the statement could be verified
by the evidence of their own senses.</p>

<p>Two boats were coming up the western shore of the
island, both loaded nearly to the gunwales, and evidently
heading for the place where the little party was standing.</p>

<p>“There’s no question about those being the <em>Day Dream’s</em>
tenders,” Jenkins said, after a long scrutiny. “White
boats with gilt ribbons are not so plentiful in these waters
that there can be more than two sets near here.”</p>

<p>“I suppose father has anchored further down the coast,
and is coming up to look for us,” Gil said, in a tone of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The mate made no reply, but a troubled look came over
his face, and this deepened into positive dismay as Andy
said:</p>

<p>“It beats me why dey’s done gone anchored wid a fine
breeze what would bring de yacht up hyar like a race
hoss.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they saw the blacks when the other boats left
the island, and want to keep them in sight,” Nelse suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>This was not a very reasonable proposition, but Gil accepted
it, since he could think of nothing better, and
Jenkins stood silent and motionless until the occupants of
the crafts could be distinguished. Then he muttered half
to himself:</p>

<p>“If they have left the craft at anchor, not one has remained
behind to look out for her, because the whole
crew is here.”</p>

<p>Gil was about to ask what he meant, when they were
hailed by Captain Mansfield from the leading craft.</p>

<p>“Ahoy on shore!”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir!” the mate replied.</p>

<p>“Are the boys all right?”</p>

<p>“Sound and hearty, sir, and none the worse for havin’
stopped ashore a little too long. Where is the yacht?”</p>

<p>“Off Pearl Point in forty fathoms of water.”</p>

<p>“Is she wrecked?” Gil asked in dismay.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you the particulars when we get ashore,” Captain
Mansfield replied. “It’s too hard work to tell much
of a story while it is necessary to shout.”</p>

<p>“De voudoos done gone did it,” Andy said, in a low
tone. “I ’lowed dis yere was gwine ter happen when I
brung de charm ashore, but de captain ’sisted on some ob
de crew cumin’, an’ it had ter be done.”</p>

<p>“I won’t lay it on the voudoos,” Gil replied, mournfully,
“but it is certainly true that we’ve had nothing but bad
luck from the moment we decided to hunt for the pirates’
treasure.”</p>

<p>“An’ you’se gwine ter hab wuss ef dis yere diggin’ is<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
kep’ up. It’s a pow’ful bad plan ter fool ’round’ whar
dem debbils hang out.”</p>

<p>The boys were not in the humor to discuss this phase of
the affair at this moment. Both felt as if they were personally
responsible for the disaster, because of having
urged Captain Mansfield to allow them to spend a certain
length of time on the island, and the knowledge that all
hands would now be forced to remain at this place was
far from cheering.</p>

<p>These gloomy thoughts were in their minds when the
bows of the boats were run up on the sand, and after the
first hearty greetings had been exchanged the brief story
of the wreck was told.</p>

<p>After leaving her anchorage the <em>Day Dream</em> was
headed down the coast for the purpose of running into
Gonaive, where a commodious and safe harbor would be
found.</p>

<p>The night was dark, the gale so furious that the little
craft could not look up to it as she should have done, and
a miscalculation as to the distance run caused her to be
brought around just in time to strike the reefs west of
Pearl Point.</p>

<p>By what, at that moment, was believed to be a rare
piece of good fortune, she slipped off into deep water after
the first shock, but the sharp coral had rent and torn her
timbers so cruelly that all efforts to keep her afloat were
useless.</p>

<p>It was possible to work her under the lee of the land,
where she was sheltered, to a certain degree, from the
angry blast, and the crew took to the boats, with such<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
supplies as could be gotten at in the hurry and excitement
of the moment, the jaunty little craft going to the
bottom before they had had time to row more than a
dozen yards from her side.</p>

<p>“When the gale partially abated we started for this
island to satisfy ourselves that you were safe, and now I
propose to make Cuba in one of the boats, taking with me
a couple of men,” Captain Mansfield said, when his story
was concluded. “We have got canvas enough for a small
sail, and once at Havana there will be no trouble about
chartering a craft to run over here.”</p>

<p>“Is it safe to go so far in the tender?” Gil asked, in
alarm.</p>

<p>“The distance to the coast of Cuba is only seventy
miles, and, with a fair wind, we should be able to make
that in less than twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“But why not take all hands?”</p>

<p>“I would like to if our boats were large enough, but
with these cockle-shells it couldn’t be done. The only
question to be considered is whether you will be safe here.
Tell me what happened after you landed?”</p>

<p>Gil gave his father a detailed account of their adventures,
Jenkins and Andy adding to the story from time to
time, and when it was concluded Captain Mansfield said:</p>

<p>“Andy’s idea of using the rockets was a capital one, and
I don’t think we need have any fear the blacks will return
for some time, but if they should, your crowd is large
enough to resist an ordinary attack. I don’t expect to
be away more than four days, and you can surely hold out
as long as that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>“Am I to go with you, sir?” Jenkins asked.</p>

<p>“No; you must stay here in charge of the party, and
the boys are to obey your orders as they would mine.
Now we will see what can be done toward getting breakfast,
and then set about making ready for the voyage.”</p>

<p>Andy immediately took up the duties as cook, and while
he and the boys went for a supply of shell fish, Jenkins
and one of the sailors started in search of water, for, now
that the party was so large, a greater amount of the
precious liquid would be needed.</p>

<p>Captain Mansfield lost no time in making his preparations.
He was desirous of taking advantage of the first
fair wind, and therefore everything was done on this day.
Even the water and provisions were put on board the
tender, so that it would be only necessary to launch her
when the proper moment should arrive.</p>

<p>It was yet quite early in the afternoon when the work
was finished, and Gil urged his father to go with him
and Nelse to the old palm.</p>

<p>“If we are to stay here three or four days there is no
reason why we shouldn’t continue to hunt for the treasure,
since it will serve to occupy the time, but Andy believes
something terrible will happen if we do such a thing.”</p>

<p>“If you find any pleasure in digging, keep at it, by all
means,” Captain Mansfield said, laughingly, “but I don’t
care to walk even a dozen yards for the purpose of seeing
an old tree. Andy’s foolish talk needn’t trouble you, for
it is merest nonsense to think a voudoo can do more than
any other person.”</p>

<p>Gil wanted to get his father’s advice as to the best<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
method of testing the correctness of the chart, but all
pleadings were in vain.</p>

<p>The captain refused to make any suggestion whatever,
and the subject was soon dropped, as the coming voyage
was brought up for discussion.</p>

<p>During the afternoon one of the sailors walked several
miles along the eastern and southern coast to make certain
the blacks were not returning, and in the hope of
sighting some sail, but both these missions resulted in the
same manner.</p>

<p>No craft of any kind could be seen, and at an early
hour all hands “turned in” on the sand, it being thought
unnecessary to stand watch.</p>

<p>It was not yet daylight when the boys were awakened
by Jenkins, who said, as they opened their eyes:</p>

<p>“The wind has come around from the south’ard an’
east’ard, and the captain is ready to start.”</p>

<p>The little tender had already been launched, and it was
only necessary for the voyagers to step aboard.</p>

<p>At the last moment Captain Mansfield had decided to
take but one of the sailors with him, in order that as large
a force as possible might be left behind in case the blacks
should return bent on mischief, and the remainder of the
party stood on the beach to say good-by.</p>

<p>“We won’t go very strong on the parting business,”
the captain said, as he saw by the faces of Gil and Nelse
that they were considerably distressed because of his
leaving. “With this wind we shall be on shore again by
sunset, and the trip will be nothing more than child’s play.<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
Keep together as much as possible, and remember that
Mr. Jenkins is in command.”</p>

<p>Then he took his seat at the helm, the tiny sail was
hoisted, and in a few seconds the little craft was lost to
view amid the gloom.</p>

<p>Those who had been left behind set about getting
breakfast, for the voyagers preferred to eat theirs in the
boat rather than lose time by waiting on shore until a meal
could be cooked, and when this very important portion of
the day’s duties was finished the question arose as to what
should first be done.</p>

<p>Jenkins sent Andy down the coast to watch lest the
blacks should return unobserved, and then the boys proposed
that they be allowed to continue the search for the
supposed treasure.</p>

<p>To this the mate agreed after some slight hesitation,
and once more the work of digging was begun, but on
this occasion fathoms instead of feet were measured off,
according to the suggestion of the sailor, who said:</p>

<p>“It don’t stand to reason that any decent pirates would
put down figgers ’cordin’ to shore lingo. It’s fathoms, or
I’m a duffer.”</p>

<p>Whether or no he was a “duffer,” both Gil and Nelse
were willing to try the experiment, more especially since
the first attempt resulted in such a signal failure, and
when the bearings had been taken&mdash;this time accurately
with one of the compasses saved from the <em>Day Dream</em>&mdash;the
boys went to work in good earnest, assisted now and
then by the men.</p>

<p>During an hour they labored industriously without having<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
seen anything to give encouragement, and just as
Gil was on the point of saying that he had had enough of
digging for supposititious gold, the spade struck something
which gave forth a metallic sound.</p>

<p>“There’s more than earth down here!” he exclaimed,
triumphantly, plying the tool with renewed vigor, and
Jenkins leaped into the excavation as he cried:</p>

<p>“Upon my word, lad, I believe there’s something in that
chart after all. Give me the spade until we see what’s
below here!”</p>

<p>Now all hands were literally trembling with excitement,
as the mate threw out the loose sand in a perfect shower,
and when several fragments of decayed wood were disclosed
each one believed the desired discovery was about
to be made.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The treasure seekers were not kept long in suspense
after the first evidence that there was some foreign substance
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes Jenkins cleared the sand away,
exposing to view an iron-bound hatch, which presented
the appearance of having been taken from a small vessel.
It showed every sign of age. The iron was so eaten with
rust as to be nothing more than thin ribbons of metal,
and the wood had been bored by insects or worms until it
looked like a gigantic sieve.</p>

<p>“If there’s any treasure on this island here’s where we
shall find it,” the mate said, as he paused to wipe the
perspiration from his face. “It don’t stand to reason that
men would spend their time burying a thing like this, and
then make a chart to show exactly the spot, unless there
was something valuable underneath.”</p>

<p>“Of course there’s plenty of gold down there, and perhaps
we shall find a lot of diamonds and jewelry,” Gil
cried, excitedly. “Why don’t you lift it up?”</p>

<p>“That’s more than can be done from below here, unless
the hole is made at least twice as large, which will be
too much work to suit me. There are some pieces of rope
on the beach that were left over after we finished riggin’<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
the boat. Get them, an’ we’ll soon have a purchase that’ll
raise this ’ere cover mighty easy.”</p>

<p>Both the boys started for the shore at full speed. They
were too much excited to be able to converse about the
matter, and, without saying a single word, gathered up
the desired articles, returning to the scene of the discovery
in a wonderfully short space of time.</p>

<p>When they arrived Andy had come up from the beach
to report that no craft of any kind was in sight, and he
stood looking at the ancient hatch in silent horror.</p>

<p>“You see the chart we found meant something after
all!” Nelse cried, triumphantly, as Jenkins set about rigging
a rude purchase to a tree which stood near by.</p>

<p>“It meant dat we wus boun’ ter git inter de biggest kin’
ob trubble,” the old darky replied, after a short pause.
“You hear me, chillun, dis yere is a mighty bad bizness.
Ef you’se ain’ hankerin’ arter de wuss scrape you’se ebber
heard ob, kiver dat hol’ up right smart.”</p>

<p>“But what is the matter with your charm?” Nelse
asked. “It worked well since the voudoos got hold of us,
and why should it fail now?”</p>

<p>“It ain’ strong enuf fur dis kin’ ob fussin’&mdash;nuffin
would stan’ dat,” Andy replied, moodily.</p>

<p>“Now don’t begin your croaking again,” Jenkins said,
with a laugh, the apparent certainty of finding treasure
causing him to feel very happy. “We’ve pulled through
so far, an’ I reckon there won’t be anything startling
happen before we can get a peep of what is underneath
this hatch.”</p>

<p>“How’s you’se bin pullin’ trou’?” the old darky asked,<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
angrily. “Didn’t you’se cum widin a han’s bref ob bein’
killed?”</p>

<p>“But we wasn’t, and the rockets instead of your charm
did the business for us.”</p>

<p>“Has yer done forget when de men set us driftin’ ’roun’
in de little boat?”</p>

<p>“We got our own jest the same, and didn’t have to
undergo many hardships.”</p>

<p>“Kin yer git de yacht ag’in? Ain’ she dun bin sunk
by de voudoos?”</p>

<p>“She is sunk, for a fact, but the fellows on this island
didn’t have anything to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Who tole yer so?”</p>

<p>“My own common sense.”</p>

<p>“Den let yer common sense show yer how ter git outer
de scrape what you’se hankerin’ fur now,” and Andy
stalked solemnly away, not so much as turning his head
when the boys begged of him to wait until the hatch
should be raised.</p>

<p>At that moment, when they were all so happy at the
apparently successful result of their labors, the old
darky’s anger seemed very comical, and no one tried to
restrain his mirth, until Jenkins said:</p>

<p>“This won’t do if we want to find out how much
treasure the pirates have buried here. All hands tail onto
the rope, and we’ll soon have gold enough to tassel our
handkerchiefs in great shape.”</p>

<p>It required considerable labor to raise the cumbersome
mass of wood and iron, but it was finally accomplished,
and, as the hatch swung above the surface each member<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
of the party rushed to the edge of the excavation excitedly.</p>

<p>Instead of seeing a vast amount of valuable plunder
such as pirates are supposed to hide, nothing more
startling than a deep hole or shaft met their gaze.</p>

<p>“The stuff must be at the bottom,” Gil said, after all
had looked in silence for several moments.</p>

<p>“It’s a shaft of some kind,” Jenkins added, half to himself,
“and I reckon we’ve had our labor for our pains.
Old Andy knew what he was about when he refused to
have anything to do with the scheme.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t certain that we’ve worked for nothing,” Nelse
replied. “I can see what appear to be steps cut in the
side, and as likely as not we shall find all we want at the
bottom.”</p>

<p>“Seeing there’s nothin’ better to do, we might as well
find out the whole story. Lay hold of that rope an’ lower
me down.”</p>

<p>In another instant the mate was descending. His companions
were able to perform their portion of the task
with but little difficulty because he found a foothold here
and there by which he could aid himself.</p>

<p>At least twenty feet of the rope had been payed out,
when he shouted:</p>

<p>“I’m at the bottom, and there is a tunnel which runs on
the level. Lower something for a torch, and I’ll keep on.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t we all come down?” Gil asked.</p>

<p>“There’s nothin’ to prevent. Throw some light wood
in first, and then make the rope fast to a tree. You can
come hand over hand without any trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>After gathering what would be sufficient to supply the
party with torches for several hours, Jenkins’ orders were
obeyed, and the boys and the sailors were soon with the
mate in a tunnel leading at right angles from the shaft,
of sufficient height for one to walk upright. The passage
looked as if it had been hewn from the solid coral, and,
although evidently not used for many years, the air was
pure as if it had never been closed.</p>

<p>Some little difficulty was experienced in lighting the
wood, but when that had been done, Jenkins marched on,
holding the torch as high as possible, that all might see
this underground path which was supposed to lead to the
valuable deposit.</p>

<p>“It’s certain this tunnel wasn’t dug for nothing,” Gil
said, after they had walked at an ordinary pace for at
least twenty minutes without having seen anything but
the coral walls. “People wouldn’t spend much time on
such work simply for fun, and it must have required
many days to hew out such an amount of rock.”</p>

<p>“I reckon we’ve come to the end,” Jenkins replied, as
the passage began to trend upward at a very decided inclination,
and a moment later he stopped at what appeared
to be the termination of the tunnel.</p>

<p>Before them was apparently a solid wall, but, as the
light was thrown on it, Gil could see a crevice, very narrow
and nearly filled with dust, at the side and bottom.</p>

<p>“It’s a door!” he cried, “and behind it is the gold!”</p>

<p>Jenkins handed the torch to Nelse, and threw his whole
weight against the rock.</p>

<p>It yielded slightly, giving an opening not more than<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
half an inch wide, through which warm air and a glow as
of a fire entered the tunnel.</p>

<p>Quickly, and without speaking, the mate extinguished
the torch, and, to the astonishment of all, the sound of
voices could be heard, indistinctly, it is true, but sufficiently
to make it positive human beings were conversing
at no very great distance from the aperture.</p>

<p>This was a conclusion to the tour of discovery upon
which the explorers had not reckoned, and for several
moments all stood in silent dismay, not knowing what
course to pursue.</p>

<p>Then Jenkins tried to close the stone door, but in vain.
It was perfectly smooth, and he could gain no hold
upon it.</p>

<p>But few seconds were spent on the useless work.</p>

<p>Whispering softly, the mate directed his companions to
retrace their steps with as little noise as possible, and all
hands crept back through the now dark tunnel to the foot
of the shaft which they had entered.</p>

<p>“What are we to do now?” Gil asked, impatiently.</p>

<p>“That’s just what we must decide upon,” Jenkins replied,
“an’ it isn’t going to be an easy question to answer.”</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose the men are?” Nelse asked. “I
thought it was certain all the blacks had left the island.”</p>

<p>“It seems that we made a mistake in coming to that
conclusion. I’ve an idea the tunnel leads straight back to
the cave where we had the pleasure of spending one
night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[163]</span></p>

<p>“Then the apparent mystery can be explained if we
make a search there,” Gil suggested.</p>

<p>“You are right, but it will be a good idea to hunt
mighty cautiously, or we may find ourselves in a worse
scrape than before. You stay here while I take a short
trip in that direction, and at the same time warn Andy of
what has been discovered.”</p>

<p>Both of the boys were unwilling the party should
separate. Strength of numbers seemed to be their only
protection, and the loss of one would be very serious.</p>

<p>Jenkins, however, was positive his plan offered the only
chance of safety, and after some discussion the others
agreed to it.</p>

<p>“I’ll take one of the revolvers, and you fellows will
have the other. It is likely that I shall be away some
time, therefore you mustn’t get nervous if I stay nearly
all day. You had better get in the tunnel half-a-dozen
yards from the shaft, so your voices won’t be heard if
anybody happens to come this way.”</p>

<p>“But what about Andy?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to make him come down here, for it isn’t safe
to remain where those people, whoever they are, may find
an opportunity of getting hold of him.”</p>

<p>After giving these orders, Jenkins swarmed up the
rope hand over hand, and, without so much as an “adieu,”
disappeared from the view of those in the shaft.</p>

<p>The three waited in almost perfect silence during fully
half-an-hour, and then, as a slight rustling was heard
from above, the cook’s head could be seen at the edge of
the excavation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[164]</span></p>

<p>His black face was literally gray with terror, and one
would have said his eyeballs protruded very much more
than usual as he asked, in a hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>“Am it er fac’ dat you chillun reckon on stayin’ hyar
wid de whole crowd ob voudoos so nigh at han’?”</p>

<p>“What else can we do?”</p>

<p>“Come out an’ hide whar dere’s a chance to gib de debbils
de slip ef dey begin’ cuttin’ up shines.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A TRAP.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The sailors, superstitious as are nearly all their class,
believed the wisest course would be to follow the old
darky’s advice, arguing that since he knew more about
the island and the ways of the repulsive beings who had
been found upon it, than any one else, it was reasonable
to suppose he could best extricate them from their uncomfortable
situation.</p>

<p>Both Gil and Nelse, however, were determined to stay
where they were until Jenkins returned, and to this end
the former said to Andy:</p>

<p>“Come down here until you know what has been found.
There can be no danger, since you’ve got your charm with
you, and we are now positive that all the blacks have not
left the island.”</p>

<p>“I dun seed ’em go wif my own eyes.”</p>

<p>“You saw three boats; but I tell you there are more not
far from here, and, what is worse, it’s the old ones who
have been left behind.”</p>

<p>Andy appeared incredulous until the sailors joined with
Gil in the statement, and then, looking around suspiciously,
as if expecting to see his enemies near at hand
ready to spring upon him, the cook prepared to descend
by first clutching firmly the mysterious “something”
which was concealed beneath the bosom of his shirt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[166]</span></p>

<p>On reaching the bottom of the shaft he went through a
series of gestures, probably intended for the purpose of
warding off danger, and then whispered, cautiously:</p>

<p>“Wha’ hab you seen, honey? Don’t try to fool wid de
ole man, kase dis yere am no kinder time ter play pranks
when de wustes’ sort ob trubble am cummin’.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to fool you,” Gil replied, impatiently,
“but it is necessary you should know that there are people
in a sort of cave, perhaps the very one where we were
kept prisoners, and their voices can be heard distinctly if
you listen at the end of this tunnel, where it looks as if a
wall of solid rock rose right up before you. Go on, and
try to make out what they are talking about.”</p>

<p>While speaking, the boy had seized the old darky by
the arm, as if to force him onward, and the latter shrank
back with every show of terror.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go dere fur a millyon dollars, an’ dat’s eh
fac’,” Andy said, with a long-drawn sigh. “Af it’s de ole
debbils wha’ hab been lef behin’, de odders are skinnin’
roun’ fur ter get a crowd ober hyar to ketch us all.”</p>

<p>“Why would so much trouble be necessary, when they
outnumber us at least three to one?” Nelse asked.</p>

<p>“Dat’s jes’ wha’ dey don’ know, honey. De fiery sarpints
hab done made ’em t’ink we’se er hard gang, an’
dey’s gwine ter bring more ob dem ole fellers ter help
erlong wid de hoodoo.”</p>

<p>Upon this point Andy appeared to be so positive that it
would have been only a waste of time to argue the matter,
and Gil urged him to follow up the tunnel in the hope of<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
learning by the conversation who the men were in the subterranean
chamber.</p>

<p>This was a most signal failure, however, for the old
darky not only refused to take a single step in the desired
direction, but would not so much as look into the opening.</p>

<p>“I’se done gone had enuf ob sich t’ings,” he said,
solemnly, “an’ now I’m gwine ter keep my ole head outer
trubble whar dar’s a chance. Dere’s a boat hyar what
b’longs ter de captain, an’ de bes’ t’ing we kin do is ter
git ’way frum dis yere islan’ afore de witches ’gin ter take
a han’ in de muss.”</p>

<p>“We are willing to risk it a while longer, and your
charm should be sufficient to make you stay while the rest
of the party are here,” Nelse said, with a nervous laugh
which had very little mirth in it.</p>

<p>“I’se got frou takin’ chances, no matter ef I had er
hun’red charms,” the old darky replied, clutching yet
tighter that which was suspended from his neck. “We
wants ter mosey outer dis yere place, nebber min’ wha’
Job Jenkins says erbout it, kase I tells yer, chillun, it am
mighty onhealthy when dem debbils begin for to git in
dere work.”</p>

<p>Then Andy started to his feet as if on the point of
swarming up the rope again, but before he could do so
the mate appeared at the opening above, saying in a
whisper, as he began to descend:</p>

<p>“Take care, below there, for the sun blinds my eyes so
I can’t see where I’m going.”</p>

<p>In another instant he was in the midst of the anxious<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
group, all of whom, with the exception of Andy, began
to overwhelm him with questions.</p>

<p>“It won’t take long for me to tell the story,” Jenkins
said, as he seated himself on the ground. “There is no
question but that this passage leads to the big cave. I
went there, and hunted around quite a while before finding
any signs of another outlet. Things were just as
when I saw them last, an’ I could ’a’ taken my oath the
whole crowd skipped out after the second dose of signal
rockets, until I ran across what appeared to be a door cut
in a piece of coral.”</p>

<p>“Did you open it?” Gil asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Of course. What would ’a’ been the use of lookin’ if
I didn’t do the thing in proper shape? I pried the stone
open till I could see a narrow passage that led in this
direction, an’ then I stopped, for there was no reason of
pokin’ my nose into danger. I reckon we’d better take to
the boat, if we can manage to stow into the one we’ve got,
for if that crowd comes back, as I feel certain they’re
bound to do, we’ll be in hot water.”</p>

<p>“Now you’se torkin’ sense,” Andy said quickly. “When
a man shoves his head inter de lion’s mout’ once, dat may
be a mistake; but ef he does it de secon’ time, dat shows
how big er fool he kin make ob hisself.”</p>

<p>The sailors were also eager to get away from such a
dangerous locality, and against this preponderance of
opinion neither Gil nor Nelse thought he should make any
objections, although both believed the safest plan would
be to take the chances and await Captain Mansfield’s return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>

<p>Now that the mate shared his opinion in regard to leaving
the island, Andy was in a perfect fever to get away,
and, without waiting for the others, he swarmed up the
rope to the surface, the remainder of the party following
a few seconds later, urged to what seemed foolish haste
by his description of the dangers which threatened.</p>

<p>“Don’t stay down dar torkin’ ’bout nuffin,” he said instantly,
on gaining the surface. “I’se been right yere
afore, an’ knows how dese images kin skip ’roun’ when
dey has bizness. We’se boun’ to mosey erlong like er
flea, ’less we wants ter be cotched ergin.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t run the risk of carryin’ away your spars
by crackin’ on too much sail,” said Jenkins, with a laugh.
“I allow the fellers won’t be back for two or three days,
an’ we can take things easy.”</p>

<p>The old darky was most vehement against delay, and
did not cease to repeat what the blacks were able to do,
until all the party were out of the tunnel. Then he would
have started toward the shore without even waiting to
gather up the small store of goods they had left on the
surface if Jenkins had not peremptorily ordered him to
stop until they were in proper marching order.</p>

<p>When the necessary arrangements had finally been
made, Andy darted through the underbrush at such speed
that the others were obliged to exert themselves to the
utmost in order to keep pace with him, and the heat rendered
rapid traveling both painful and exhausting.</p>

<p>“Let him go ahead,” Jenkins said, impatiently, after
five minutes passed, during which the whole party had
been running rather than walking. “He’s worse than an<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
old woman when he gets frightened, an’ we couldn’t move
faster than we’re doin’ now if the whole crowd were at
our heels.”</p>

<p>“There’s no reason why we shouldn’t take our time,”
and Gil halted for a comfortable breath. “It will be
better to start after dark, anyway, for no one could row
very long in this heat.”</p>

<p>Having thus allayed their own nervousness, the little
party proceeded toward the beach in a most leisurely
fashion, until the sound of the surf told that they were
very near the sea, when Andy burst through the underbrush
at a faster gait than he had departed.</p>

<p>His black face was of an ashen hue, and his eyes open
and staring as he said, in a hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>“De boat’s dun gone!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, you fool?” the mate asked,
angrily.</p>

<p>“She’s gone, an’ dat’s a fac’. Dem ole debbils knowed
wha’ we was er tryin’ ter do, an’ dey’ve hoodooed her
outer sight!”</p>

<p>“Probably you didn’t go within half-a-mile of where
we left her.”</p>

<p>“Dere’s de tree we hitched her to, an’ you kin see whar
dem as took her off walked ’roun’ huntin’ for us.”</p>

<p>“Then what you mean is that the crowd have come
back, an’ we’re cut off again,” Jenkins replied, in a tone of
relief, despite his oft-repeated assertion that he did not
believe in what Andy called “cunjurin’.”</p>

<p>“Dat am de fac’.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said the old men had hoodooed her?”<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
Nelse added, and the old darky said, with considerable
show of spirit:</p>

<p>“Ob course dey did, else how could dem wuffless trash
know where to fin’ her?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be a bad idea to have a look at the beach,”
Jenkins said, as he took a revolver from his pocket. “Just
as likely as not Andy has made a mistake.”</p>

<p>The others pressed forward, but the cook refused to
move a single step. He declared that no earthly power
could force him to leave the shelter of the trees, and was
so vehement in his protestations that even the boys began
to think perhaps it would be as well to exercise a little
caution.</p>

<p>“Don’t rush right out in the open, for fear those who
stole the boat may see you,” Gil said to the mate. “Perhaps
the best way would be for us to stay here while you
have a look around.”</p>

<p>“All right, keep under cover, an’ I’ll soon be back,” Mr.
Jenkins said, as he disappeared from view amid the
foliage, and the remainder of the party waited in silence
for his return.</p>

<p>They were not to be kept very long in suspense. Five
minutes later the mate returned looking very serious, and
Nelse asked, eagerly:</p>

<p>“What did you see?”</p>

<p>“Enough to make me wish your father had waited one
day longer. From the appearances I should say a regular
mob of men had been around where we left the boat, and
there is little doubt but that they are the same kind of a
crowd we saw dancin’ near the fire. They’ve made off<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
with our craft, an’ now count on huntin’ us down at their
leisure.”</p>

<p>Although this information was no more alarming than
what Andy had predicted, the old darky seemed to be
literally paralyzed with fear. He remained silent and
motionless, staring at Mr. Jenkins as if in the latter’s
face he could read even more terrible intelligence than
had already been imparted.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">RUN TO COVER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Andy was not the only one who felt as if an unkind
fortune had dealt the crowning blow in a series of disasters,
and that it would be useless to struggle longer
against such overwhelming odds.</p>

<p>It is true the little party were armed, after a certain
fashion, and could act on the defensive for a short time in
a creditable manner; but the supply of ammunition was
woefully small, and when the last cartridge should have
been fired they had only two knives and two hatchets with
which to hold their own against a party of perhaps forty.</p>

<p>To each one these thoughts came much as if they had
been presented for consideration, and, after five minutes
or more had been spent in mournful reflections, Jenkins
said, with a feeble attempt at cheerfulness:</p>

<p>“It’s worse than foolish for us to sit here moonin’ over
what we’ve got to meet like men. It’ll be strange if we
can’t hold our own against such a crowd as is on this
island; but we sha’n’t make any headway by suckin’ our
thumbs.”</p>

<p>“You are the leader, and we are waiting to hear what
you propose doing,” Gil replied, forcing himself to speak
firmly and even carelessly, because of the effect he knew
his words would have upon the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what I haven’t had time to decide on,” Jenkins
said, deliberately. “Suppose we try to cook up some plan
between us? What is your opinion, Andy?”</p>

<p>The old darky shook his head, but made no reply. He
was without hope, and could do no more than clutch the
charm which was covered by his shirt; but even his faith
in this seemed to have been shaken by the news that the
main body of the enemy had returned to the island.</p>

<p>Jenkins waited a few seconds for some one to speak,
and, as all remained silent, he said, in a thoughtful tone:</p>

<p>“It stands to reason we’ve only got to hold our own a
few days at the outside, for the captain is bound to be
back before long, and then all the trouble will be at an
end. It is now so near night that I reckon we can count
on bein’ left alone till mornin’, an’, with so much time
before us, we ought to be able to make considerable headway
takin’ care of ourselves. The first thing is to find a
hidin’-place, an’ Andy knows more about this island than
any one else, so he must attend to that portion of the
work.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be did,” the old fellow said, in a whisper.
“Dem brack debbils done gone know ebbry spot on dis
yere islan’ whar a skeeter could poke his nose, an’ dey’s
boun’ to hab us out ’fore ter-morrer mornin’.”</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen,” Gil replied. “It is certain
they’ll get hold of us if we sit here doing nothing, but it
must be possible to hide during the short time father will
be gone.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Gil, an’ if we don’t lose our pluck,
things is sure to come out all right,” Jenkins said, approvingly.<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
“It won’t do to trust to the shelter of the
trees, for those fellows can track us down; so I go in for
hittin’ on some spot where we can hold out against them
till the captain comes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but where’ll we find such a place?” Nelse asked.</p>

<p>“That is what we must hunt for, an’ there’s no time to
lose, because it’ll soon be too dark to travel around much.”</p>

<p>Jenkins looked toward Andy as he spoke, but the old
darky did not so much as move an eyelid. He acted as if
all hope had fled, and he was trying to resign himself to
the inevitable.</p>

<p>“I should think it would be a good idea to hunt around
for food before we go into hiding,” Nelse said, after a
pause. “We may be obliged to keep under cover quite a
while, and, according to the experience I have had on this
island, it isn’t always convenient to go whenever a fellow
feels so disposed.”</p>

<p>“You are right, my boy, and I’ll hunt for a hiding-place
if the rest will act on your suggestion. We can
meet here any time between now an’ sunset, so there’ll be
no danger of losing each other. Andy, show them
where the shell fish can be found easiest.”</p>

<p>The cook, who had thrown himself on the ground as if
in such despair that his legs could no longer be depended
upon to do their duty, rose slowly and silently, which was
sufficient intimation that he would so far oblige, however
unnecessary he might think it to provide for a party who
were doomed to death.</p>

<p>“Bring in everything eatable you can find,” Jenkins<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
said, and then started through the underbrush to perform
his portion of the work.</p>

<p>Gil was forced to speak quite sharply to Andy before
the latter would lead the way toward the beach, but after
the old fellow once started he did his best to procure the
provisions in the shortest possible space of time.</p>

<p>When the party left the shelter of the trees, and walked
cautiously out on the sands, where the gentle swell of the
sea was rolling up in tinkling measures, not a sign of the
enemy could be seen. It was as if they were alone on
the island, and, while this apparent security caused the
others to feel considerably more confident than at any
time since it had been discovered the boat was stolen, it
filled Andy with the gravest apprehensions.</p>

<p>“I’se done been hyar afore,” he said, with a solemn
shake of the head, “an’ I tell yer, honey, we’se gwine ter
hab a power ob trubble.”</p>

<p>“There don’t seem to be any signs of it around here,”
Nelse replied, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Dat’s kase yer don’t know wha’ kin’ ob folks dese yere
imps be, honey. Dey’s layin’ low like now; but look out
fur ’em, look out, I say, an’ don’ trus’ de snake jes’ kase
he ain’ in de humor fur bitin’. Dey’s done got dere eyes
on us now, an’ when de right time comes we’se gwine to
fin’ it out.”</p>

<p>“If they don’t do any more than keep their eyes on us
for the next hour we shall stand a good chance of laying
in a stock of provisions, for the oysters appear to be
plentiful on this part of the beach.”</p>

<p>Andy contented himself with simply shaking his head,<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
as if to say he could tell a great deal more if he felt disposed,
and then all hands began industriously gathering
the shell fish, which were to be seen just above the low
water mark in enormous beds.</p>

<p>It was hard work to detach them from the seaweed and
rocks, but the little party were literally laboring for life,
and before an hour had passed a heavy load for each member
was secured.</p>

<p>“There’s no need of taking more than we can lug comfortably,”
Gil said, when the tide had covered the largest
beds, “and now comes the question of how they may be
carried to the place where we agreed to meet Jenkins.”</p>

<p>“I reckon my mate an’ me can rig up somethin’ that’ll
answer for baskets,” one of the sailors replied, as he began
gathering a quantity of vines, and in this labor Andy
assisted without being especially requested so to do.</p>

<p>Under the skillful fingers of the three men the vines
soon assumed shape, and the sun was yet above the
horizon when five rude receptacles had been woven.</p>

<p>After these were filled with oysters it was found that
each one had as much of a load as could comfortably be
carried on his back, and, laden heavily, all hands started
for the rendezvous, arriving there just as the mate returned,
looking tired and disappointed.</p>

<p>“We’ve done our portion of the work,” Gil said, cheerily,
“and what have you accomplished?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’, so far as a hidin’-place is concerned. It won’t
do to go so far into the interior of the island that we
stand a chance of gettin’ lost while tryin’ to find our way
back to the beach, an’ I can’t find a spot where anything<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
bigger than a rabbit could hide himself this side of the
cave.”</p>

<p>“Did you see anything of the blacks?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the whole crowd are near the entrance, an’ from
the appearance of things they have got over the scare we
gave ’em.”</p>

<p>“How many are there?”</p>

<p>“Thirty at the lowest calculation, without countin’ them
as were hidin’ in the cave. All hands are loafin’ around
the entrance, as if not carin’ whether we saw them or not,
an’ I reckon they’ve sized us up mighty nigh right.”</p>

<p>“But what are we to do to-night?” Nelse asked, his
voice betraying the uneasiness he felt.</p>

<p>“There is only one plan I can think of, which is to get
into the tunnel we found.”</p>

<p>“Why, that would be putting ourselves directly in their
power!” Nelse cried, and Andy looked at Jenkins as if
fancying the mate had suddenly lost his reason.</p>

<p>“When it comes to dots, we are in their power already,
and without much chance to defend ourselves, if they
should surround us in this thick underbrush. There we
could hold our own for a while, at any rate, because not
more than one could attack us at a time, an’ our revolvers
would keep ’em back a good many hours.”</p>

<p>The boys immediately recognized the force of the argument,
as did both the sailors, but Andy was literally
beside himself with impatience because such a scheme
had been proposed.</p>

<p>“I’se done gone got enuff ob dis yere crowd,” he said,
angrily. “When you cotch de old man runnin’ his nose<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
inter de hornet’s nes’ jes’ tell him he’s makin’ a mighty
big fool outer hisself. We’se bad enuff hyar widout
makin’ it wuss.”</p>

<p>“But, Andy, it really seems to be the best thing we can
do,” Gil said, persuasively. “It is as Mr. Jenkins says&mdash;we
shall at least have a chance of defending ourselves
there, and it’s only necessary to hold out until father gets
back before the trouble will be at an end. Then we can
show these scoundrels a trick or two at hunting which
perhaps they won’t appreciate so well.”</p>

<p>“I ’preciate dis yere scrape, an’ ain’ gwine ter put my
nose in any mo’,” the old fellow replied, doggedly. “Ef
you is boun’ dar, go ahead, an’ Andy’ll kinder grub ’roun’
fur hisself.”</p>

<p>“But we mustn’t separate, you obstinate old man!
Can’t you see that there’s a chance, with all this food, of
holding our own a good many hours?”</p>

<p>“Whar’s de water? Bymby somebody’s gwine ter
want er drink, an’ den whar’ll de debbils be?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” Gil exclaimed, in dismay,
and Jenkins added, quickly:</p>

<p>“We must try to lay in a stock to-night. I’ll run the
risk of snoopin’ round a bit after dark, an’ it’ll be hard
lines if I can’t bring in a little. At any rate, it’s better to
be in the tunnel, where we’ve got a show for our lives, an’
be thirsty, than stay out here where all hands can be surrounded
by daylight. If Andy won’t go with us I don’t
see any other way than let him paddle his own canoe.”</p>

<p>The sailors decided in favor of the mate, and Gil and<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
Nelse could do no less than agree with the more experienced
and less timid portion of the party.</p>

<p>“We’ll go to the tunnel,” Gil decided, after a pause,
“and if Andy wants to stay outside it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p>“I’se gwine ter look arter myself,” the cook replied,
doggedly, and, without further conversation, he disappeared
among the underbrush.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SECRET OF THE CAVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The cook hurried away so quickly that his companions
had no time to persuade him to a different course, even
provided they wished to do so, and when he was out of
sight Jenkins said, as he took up the load of oysters which
Andy brought:</p>

<p>“It won’t do any good for us to stay here talkin’ about
what the old fool has done, for we must get under cover
before it is too dark to admit of seeing our way through
the woods. His pig-headedness may cost him his life,
but we are not to blame. It only remains for us to take
care of ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Do you propose to go directly there, or shall we circle
around so they can’t track us easily?” Nelse asked.</p>

<p>“It’ll be as well to drive ahead, I reckon; they’ll find
us out anyhow, for we can’t hide the trail any better than
these woods will do it for us.”</p>

<p>Then Jenkins signified that he was ready, and the little
party, each carrying a quantity of oysters, followed at his
heels in perfect silence.</p>

<p>The mate had the bearings of the old palm well in
mind, and went directly toward it without swerving to
the right or the left, coming to a halt only when he
reached the spot where, a few hours previous, the boys<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
had been so certain a large amount of treasure was about
to be found.</p>

<p>Although he had said that the blacks would be certain
to discover their hiding-place, he took good care not to
make any more noise than was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>“Swarm down there,” he whispered, cautiously, “and
the last man shall pull the rope after him, for it won’t do
to let those blacks have a chance to steal it.”</p>

<p>“If we do that, how will it be possible for us to come up
again?” Gil asked. “We can’t make the rope fast above
while all hands are below.”</p>

<p>“I have thought of that. We must take the chances of
climbin’ up the sides by diggin’ small holes where the
sand is hardest. At all events, I’ll guarantee we get back
here again, if they leave enough of us.”</p>

<p>One of the sailors obeyed the motions made by the
mate, and began to slip slowly down the rope. When he
was at the bottom of the shaft first one and then another
of the bags were lowered, until all had disappeared, and
then the second sailor followed his comrade.</p>

<p>“Now remember to pull the rope after you, an’ don’t
show yourselves again till you hear me speak,” Jenkins
said, as he urged Gil toward the mouth of the shaft.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Don’t you intend to come
with us?”</p>

<p>“Not just yet. We’ve got to have water, an’ I’m goin’
for some.”</p>

<p>“You’ve nothing to bring it in, no matter how much
you should find.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a scheme for attendin’ to that part of the<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
business, an’ want to leave as soon as possible, so don’t
make me stay here chinning.”</p>

<p>Gil realized that it was not the time to ask many questions,
and he obeyed without another word, after Nelse
had let himself down the opening.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes from the time the second sailor
joined the first all hands except Jenkins were crouching
in the tunnel, with the rope coiled up beside them, and
already had the shades of night gathered so densely that
it was impossible to distinguish each other, save by the
tones of the voices.</p>

<p>Now they had reached what seemed a desirable hiding-place
while the matter was under discussion, it no longer
appeared either safe or comfortable, and the prospect of
being besieged while in such cramped quarters was anything
rather than pleasant.</p>

<p>“I’m beginnin’ to think Andy had more sense than the
rest of us,” one of the sailors said, as he tried to find a
spot where he could stretch out at full length. “It’ll be
mighty hard lines after them imps shut us in here like
rats in a trap, an’, when the captain comes back, I’d like to
know how he’s goin’ to find us if there are fifteen or
twenty blacks standin’ around the openin’ up there ready
to kill the first who shows himself long enough to hail
them as may be huntin’ for us.”</p>

<p>This was a phase of the case which neither Gil nor
Nelse had taken into consideration, and they began to feel
very uncomfortable in mind.</p>

<p>“What should we do if we heard father and couldn’t
let him know where we were?” he asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[184]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” Nelse replied, with a long-drawn
sigh. “It is certain we couldn’t make our whereabouts
known, and I’m inclined to think we’ve been more
than foolish to come here.”</p>

<p>“We might leave now, and take our chances in the
woods as Andy is doing.”</p>

<p>“How would you contrive to get out?”</p>

<p>“Gracious! I’d forgotten that we’re shut in here already,”
Nelse exclaimed, and then he relapsed into silence,
while Gil tried in vain to see some cheerful ray in the
very disagreeable situation.</p>

<p>During the next half-hour nothing was said, and then
one of the sailors spoke:</p>

<p>“Never mind what’s goin’ to happen, there’s no call for
us to be hungry while there are so many oysters waitin’
to be invited to supper. Here goes for a couple of dozen.
Can you boys open them?”</p>

<p>“I never tried, but this seems like a good time to begin,”
Gil said, with a vain attempt to laugh.</p>

<p>“You’d make a poor fist if you’re green at the business.
Set close, both of you, an’ I’ll engage to fill you up
before startin’ in for myself.”</p>

<p>Speaking about food had caused the boys to remember
that they were very hungry, and they accepted the generous
proposition without delay.</p>

<p>It is certain that trouble seems less when viewed by one
whose stomach is full, as Gil and Nelse soon learned.
When the satisfactory meal was ended both ceased to
think the situation so very desperate, and actually began
to plan what steps should be taken to continue the search<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
for the supposed treasure as soon as Captain Mansfield
returned.</p>

<p>That Jenkins did not come back, although the night had
fully shut in, gave them no uneasiness, for all believed he
would play the spy once more before joining them, and it
would not be surprising if he were absent until past midnight.</p>

<p>It was dull work sitting there in the darkness after the
conversation regarding their movements when they should
be free was exhausted, and it seemed as if they must have
been in the tunnel several hours, when Gil said, with a
yawn:</p>

<p>“Of course, somebody must keep awake so’s to hear
Jenkins when he wants the rope passed up to him, but
that’s no reason why all hands of us should sit here nodding.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, lad. Turn in, an’ me an’ my mate will
’tend to the rest of the business.”</p>

<p>“But you must have some sleep.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have a chance to get plenty before leavin’ this
’ere hole, so don’t trouble your head about us.”</p>

<p>“We’ll crawl back a short piece, and try to find a place
where we can stretch out at full length,” Gil suggested,
and Nelse replied:</p>

<p>“Go ahead; I’ll follow close enough to keep hold of
your coat.”</p>

<p>Gil proceeded on his hands and knees to avoid a possible
fall, and at least twenty yards had been traversed
when his companion asked:</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we’ve gone about far enough? It<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
isn’t safe to get too near that door at the end, for there’s
no knowing when the blacks may come down this way.”</p>

<p>“Up to this point a fellow would have had to double
himself into a bowknot in order to lay down, and we’re
not so very far from the shaft. I’ll go on a little further,
and then if it hasn’t widened we might as well rejoin the
others, because&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The sentence was never finished, for at that instant
Nelse felt the earth sink beneath him, and Gil’s coat was
torn from his grasp as its owner plunged forward.</p>

<p>For a few seconds Nelse remained motionless, unable
to understand what had happened, and then he realized
that his companion must have been precipitated into a
cavity of some kind, although the floor of the tunnel appeared
firm when the whole party traversed it a few hours
previously.</p>

<p>“Gil! Gil!” he called, and it seemed almost an endless
while before the reply came:</p>

<p>“I’m all right, but I must have fallen twenty feet or
more, and the breath was pretty nearly shaken out of my
body.”</p>

<p>“What can I do to help you?”</p>

<p>“Get the rope and pull me out, for I don’t fancy staying
here all night.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t sound as if you were buried very deep.”</p>

<p>“I’m not buried at all, but simply in a big hole, which
I don’t care to explore for fear of getting into worse
trouble.”</p>

<p>By this time Nelse had collected his partially scattered
senses, and at once made his way back to the shaft with<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
all speed, startling the sailors into something very nearly
resembling fear, as he hurriedly told what had befallen
Gil.</p>

<p>“This ’ere is gettin’ too hot to suit me,” one of the men
said, in a tone of apprehension. “Who knows but that
them black scoundrels have got a way to let the whole
bottom drop out of the tunnel, an’ that’s why we’ve been
allowed to crawl in here.”</p>

<p>“Of course such a thing couldn’t be, because they had
no idea we should find the shaft&mdash;perhaps don’t know
where we are.”</p>

<p>“That may be, but I’m beginnin’ to think a good deal as
Andy does about the island’s bein’ bewitched.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do any good just now if you were positive
that such a state of affairs existed. Gil is in the hole,
and it doesn’t seem fair to leave him there while we talk
nonsense.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, lad, an’ I’m an old fool. Here’s the
rope; heave ahead an’ we’ll foller, but be careful not to
tumble into the same place.”</p>

<p>“Some one should stay here in case Jenkins comes
back,” Nelse suggested, as he began to retrace his steps,
and one of the sailors said, as he lighted his pipe:</p>

<p>“I’ll hang around. You two can ’tend to him, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>It was not an easy matter to find the cavity without
falling in, and Nelse moved forward slowly, calling to
Gil from time to time until the latter answered, thus
guiding him to the proper place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>“Where’s the rope?” he asked, and, instead of replying,
the sailor lighted a match, saying as he did so:</p>

<p>“I’d like to have a squint around before we do very
much, for it ain’t sure&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Have you got the rope?” Gil cried, impatiently.</p>

<p>“It’s here, an’ we’ll soon have you out.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you send down some kind of a light? I’ve
fallen on what I truly believe is the decaying fragments
of a chest, and unless I’m very much mistaken in regard
to what I’ve got in my hand, we’ve struck the treasure at
last.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE TREASURE CHAMBER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Strange as it may seem, Gil’s announcement caused
Nelse to forget entirely the danger by which they were
surrounded, and, regardless of the fact that none of the
party were certain of ever leaving the tunnel alive, his
only desire now was to gain possession of the supposed
hoard.</p>

<p>The sailor was not one whit less excited; he had a
stock of matches in his pockets, but could not find them
until after a search of several seconds, owing to extreme
agitation caused by Gil’s announcement.</p>

<p>“Do hurry!” Nelse cried, impatiently, as the man
fumbled about his clothing. “Something may happen to
prevent us from seeing the treasure if you spend so much
time doing nothing.”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to find another match, an’ then, perhaps,
we can rig up somethin’ that’ll answer for a torch, but it
seems as if my fingers were all thumbs jest now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t keep me waiting here all day, for I want to
know what I’ve struck,” Gil cried, and after a few seconds
more a tiny flame told that the sailor had finally succeeded
in finding that which was wanted so badly just at that
moment.</p>

<p>Nelse seized the first opportunity to search with his<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
eyes for something which would serve as a torch, but the
floor of the tunnel was as clean as though swept with a
broom, and he said to Gil:</p>

<p>“There isn’t so much as a twig here, but I reckon we
can afford to use a few matches so’s you can find out
what you’ve got. Send it up, an’ I’ll soon see if it is the
article we’ve been hunting for.”</p>

<p>“Lower the rope, and I’ll bring it.”</p>

<p>“How far down are you?” the sailor asked, as, the
match having been consumed, he crept toward the aperture.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell, but it seemed as if I fell a long distance.
We’ll soon find out if you’ll give me the chance.”</p>

<p>Nelse paid out on the rope until he was certain not less
than fifteen feet had been lowered into what he hoped
would prove to be a veritable treasure chamber, and then
Gil shouted:</p>

<p>“Hold on, I’ve got enough. You’ll have to pull me up,
for I want to come with both hands full.”</p>

<p>“Make it fast under your arms, and I reckon we’ll be
able to manage the rest.”</p>

<p>This portion of the work was quickly accomplished,
and when Gil stood beside his companions the sailor
would have lighted another match if the boys had not
prevented him.</p>

<p>“Wait until we are at the entrance, and then, perhaps,
the same light will show us materials for a torch,” Nelse
said, as he seized Gil’s arm, hurrying him toward the
shaft.</p>

<p>The man who was on watch had heard all the conversation,<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
and his excitement was quite as great as that of
the others.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a piece of paper here, an’ we’ll use it to help
out with the matches.”</p>

<p>As he and his mate twisted this firmly to prevent it
from burning too quickly, and then ignited one end, Gil
held forth the supposed treasure, and loud exclamations
of joy and surprise burst from the lips of all, as they saw
what at first glance seemed to be a mass of sparkling fire
in the boy’s hand.</p>

<p>“They’re diamonds!” Gil cried, with yet greater excitement.
“A whole string of them, and there must be
more that’s valuable where these came from.”</p>

<p>Not until the paper had been entirely consumed did
either member of the party cease to gaze at the wondrously
brilliant gems, and then all realized that they had
neglected to look for wood with which to make a torch.</p>

<p>“We must use more matches,” Nelse said, breathlessly,
“and if we can’t find wood here, one must venture out,
for we’re bound to know what is in that hole before morning.”</p>

<p>“I reckon we’ll stay right in this spot till Jenkins comes
back, seein’s how we’re prisoners so long as the rope is at
the bottom of the shaft,” Gil replied, grimly; “but it won’t
be so very hard to wait, now we know the treasure has
been found. I wonder how much more there is?”</p>

<p>“Did you feel anything else?”</p>

<p>“It seemed as if there were a lot of packages, done up
in rotten sail-cloth as these were. I felt around some,<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
but didn’t dare to move very much, for fear of getting another
fall.”</p>

<p>“Was the place a regular cave, or only a hole?”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a room built to hide things in, for there
seemed to be a floor of rock, though, of course, a good
deal of earth fell in with me, and made it appear as if
filled nearly full; but I could take several steps in half-a-dozen
directions.”</p>

<p>During this conversation the sailors had ignited another
of the precious matches, and learned to their great
disappointment that there was nothing in the shaft out of
which a torch might be made.</p>

<p>“We can afford to wait,” Gil said, philosophically, and
he had hardly ceased speaking when a low hail from the
surface caused all hands to spring to their feet.</p>

<p>“Hello below! Everything goin’ on ship-shape?”</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” one of the sailors asked, cautiously.</p>

<p>“Me&mdash;Jenkins. I only came to see if anything had
gone wrong, an’ now I know you’re all right I’ll do a
little more skirmishin’. I haven’t found anything to
bring the water in yet.”</p>

<p>“Come down first!” Gil whispered. “We’ve found a
lot of diamonds!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got fifteen or twenty big diamonds&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pass up the rope, an’ be quick about it!”</p>

<p>The sailors did in a few seconds what might have
taken the boys a long while to do, and Jenkins came down
with the greatest possible speed.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, it was necessary to use more<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
matches in order to show him the treasure, and he literally
gasped with surprise when the glittering gems were held
before his eyes.</p>

<p>“Talk about luck, boys!” he cried, in delight. “Why,
sich a sight as that makes up for the scrape we’re in, an’
if it was twice as bad I wouldn’t have it changed, providin’
we could get as much more out of the business.
That old picture amounted to somethin’ after all, didn’t
it; but we might never have read the thing right, an’ it’s
mighty fortunate them imps forced us to cover.”</p>

<p>Again Gil was forced to repeat his story, and when it
was concluded the mate insisted on making an examination
of the excavation at once.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of time to look for water after we know
how much you’ve found. I’d rather see diamonds than
drink the best stuff these old pirates ever took on board.”</p>

<p>“Get the torch, an’ we’ll all go,” Gil said, with a laugh,
for he felt very jolly, despite the enemies who would
soon hunt him down, now the location of the treasure had
been discovered.</p>

<p>Jenkins climbed to the mouth of the shaft as nimbly as
a cat, returning a few moments later, after having thrown
down inflammable material sufficient to provide the party
with light for many hours.</p>

<p>Binding together several pieces of fatty wood, and
coiling the rope on his arm, the mate led the way into
the tunnel a short distance, where the torch was ignited,
and the work of searching for the pirates’ wealth began.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in finding the place where Gil
had sunk through the bottom of the passage. The earth<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
had given way at one side of the tunnel, until a hole fully
a yard square was formed, and, peering into this, the excited
ones could see a small chamber, which was evidently
hewn from the solid rock.</p>

<p>The size or shape could not be determined, but that
made little difference just then, so eager were all to know
what was concealed beneath.</p>

<p>“You two wait to help us up,” Jenkins said to the
sailors, “and after we’ve had a squint at the place you
shall have a chance.”</p>

<p>“Will stayin’ here keep us out of a share of the stuff?”
one of the men asked, as if doubtful whether he would be
dealt with fairly.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” Gil replied, quickly. “I suppose you
will be satisfied to have father make a division of everything
that’s found, and what he says is fair you shall
have.”</p>

<p>“We’re ready to trust to the captain’s way of sizin’ the
thing up.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you’ll have to be,” Jenkins growled, “for
when it comes down to what is square, neither of us are
entitled to anything. The picture belonged to the boys,
an’ we come here in the captain’s employ, drawin’ good
wages, so the profits of the voyage oughter go to him the
same as if the <em>Day Dream</em> had got these diamonds for
freightin’ a cargo.”</p>

<p>“But this ain’t the same thing as freightin’, by a long
shot,” was the sulky reply. “We’re on land now, an’
the yacht is at the bottom, consequently we’re our own
masters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>“You won’t say that when it comes to a question of
drawin’ wages.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t any sure thing that we’ll be paid for this kind
of work.”</p>

<p>“Now see here,” Gil said, in a tone of authority, “we
won’t have any quarreling. Whatever treasure may be
found shall benefit all hands in such proportion as father
may think best, though, of course, it wouldn’t be right to
divide it into even shares.”</p>

<p>“We don’t expect as much as he gets, but want a fair
divvy,” the second man said, sulkily, and the boys understood
that the finding of the diamonds had but given them
a new cause for anxiety, since the sailors, made greedy
by the sight of the gems, might prove worse enemies even
than the blacks.</p>

<p>“You heard the promise that Gil made, which was more
than reasonable, considerin’ they’re entitled to everything
if the matter should go inter a court of law, an’ now hold
your tongues,” Jenkins said, angrily. “We’re standin’
here fightin’ when at least one of us should be in the shaft
to know if anything is goin’ on wrong outside, an’ there’ll
be plenty of time to settle the division part when we’ve
found all that’s below.”</p>

<p>“You are takin’ up more time chinnin’ than we did,”
the older of the men replied, insolently, and Gil began to
regret having made the discovery so soon.</p>

<p>Jenkins remained silent a moment as if trying to decide
what should be done to check the apparent mutiny
before it assumed dangerous proportions, and Gil whispered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t pay any attention to what they say. Neither of
them will be dissatisfied after father comes, no matter
how much we may find.”</p>

<p>“I was wonderin’ whether we hadn’t better stop the
whole thing right here, an’ let the captain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He ceased speaking very suddenly, for at that instant a
shrill cry was heard from the direction of the shaft, and
Nelse said, as he ran forward:</p>

<p>“That was Andy! The blacks have got hold of him!”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As the boys started down the tunnel in response to the
continued cries for help, Jenkins extinguished the torch
and caught up the rope.</p>

<p>He understood that the old cook must have been very
near the shaft when he made the frenzied appeal, otherwise
his voice could not have been heard so distinctly,
and there was no necessity of letting it be known any
one else was in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Even the sailors, eager though they were to share the
treasure, did not hesitate at first to rush to the rescue and,
for the time being, everything save Andy’s danger was
forgotten.</p>

<p>On arriving at the shaft, Nelse prudently halted until
his companions could join him, and Jenkins, who arrived
a second later, whispered:</p>

<p>“Don’t even breathe loud. There’s no tellin’ where
some of them imps may be, an’ as likely as not half-a-dozen
are above there waiting to find out if we are here.”</p>

<p>This injunction was obeyed implicitly until a few moments
later, when another scream was heard, and this
time the listeners could hear distinctly the words:</p>

<p>“Gil! Nelse! Fur de lub ob heaben help de ole man!
De debbils has done cotched me, an’ I’se boun’ ter be
sarved like you’se&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>This prayer for aid ended in a smothered groan or
shriek, as if the speaker’s mouth had suddenly been closed
against his will, and Gil whispered to the mate:</p>

<p>“We mustn’t stand still here and let them kill him.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothin’ we can do in the darkness, an’ while
the whole crowd are most likely layin’ low in the hope that
we’ll rush out.”</p>

<p>“But remember what he did for us! If he hadn’t taken
some chances then we should have been murdered, and it
is better for us to run every risk now, rather than stay
here idle at such a time.”</p>

<p>Jenkins remained silent and motionless for several moments,
as if studying the situation, and then he said,
speaking slowly and thoughtfully:</p>

<p>“I’ll try my hand at helpin’ the old man, providin’ you
boys agree not to leave this place if the blacks succeed in
getting hold of me.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do nothing of the kind,” Gil replied, indignantly.
“It’s not likely you’ll be able to accomplish very much
alone, but with all hands we may manage to get the old
fellow out of their clutches. Surely with the weapons we
can make a rush they can’t stand.”</p>

<p>“That might work if it was daylight, but in the night
we have no means of knowin’ where to find the scoundrels.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t wait until morning,” Nelse nodded.
“They’ll kill him before that time.”</p>

<p>“An’ we shall share the same fate, I’m afraid,” Jenkins
replied, in hopeless tone.</p>

<p>The sailors had not joined in the conversation, but<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
stood a short distance inside the tunnel, discussing, as the
boys believed, the situation in cautious whispers.</p>

<p>Neither Gil nor Nelse proposed to remain idle while
one member of the party was in peril, even though he
had brought the trouble on himself by refusing to remain
with the others, and the former insisted most peremptorily
that the mate decide upon some plan of action in which
all could join.</p>

<p>“If you don’t, we shall go alone, for we won’t have it
to think of that the poor fellow was killed because we refused
to help him.”</p>

<p>“It’ll take half-an-hour to get out of here, now the
rope has been pulled down,” Jenkins said, as if on the
point of yielding to their demands.</p>

<p>“Then so much the more reason why we should begin
without delay. Come on, Nelse, we’ll do all that is possible,
and let the others join us or stay here as they
choose.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Gil began to grope around the sides of the
shaft in order to select that portion where the earth was
packed solidly, for the task of cutting his way upward,
and had dug with his knife a hole for one of his feet,
when Jenkins approached.</p>

<p>“Now see here, boys, I’m willin’ to do all I can, so
there’s no use in startin’ off before you’re ready. Besides,
you’ll never get out by working in that way.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, then; show us how, and we’ll do our share.”</p>

<p>Calling the sailors to him, Jenkins mounted on their
shoulders, which brought his hands within a short distance<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
of the surface, and there he stood some moments
listening.</p>

<p>No sound betokened the presence of any of the enemy,
although there was every reason to suppose one or more
might be waiting for just such a move on the part of the
white men, and then, digging his hands and feet into the
loose earth, the agile mate succeeded in clambering to the
top.</p>

<p>“Pass up the rope,” he whispered, and when this was
done he directed the boys to tie one end under their arms.</p>

<p>“I’ll pull you two up, an’ the others can look out for
themselves. Bring the revolvers, knives, an’ hatchets,
for I reckon we shall need everything we’ve got in the
way of weapons.”</p>

<p>The sailors helped the boys secure the rope under their
arms, and assisted in gathering the articles of defense;
but when the two had been drawn to the surface the men
made no move toward joining them.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come up?” Jenkins whispered, impatiently.</p>

<p>“’Cause we’ve concluded to stay here. This ain’t no
scrape of ours, an’, seein’s we’re only ’foremast hands,
it’s better manners to stay where we are.”</p>

<p>“They intend to hunt for the treasure,” Nelse whispered,
and Gil replied, in the same cautious tone:</p>

<p>“That’s a fact; but I don’t see how we can help ourselves.
It’s better to let them get away with everything
than for us to stop here guarding whatever may be in the
underground chamber while poor old Andy is being murdered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>“I reckon they won’t get very far off if they should
try to play us a scurvy trick,” Jenkins said, thus showing
that he also was thinking the sailors meditated treachery.
“We’ll pass back the rope, an’ make it a reasonably hard
job for ’em to crawl out.”</p>

<p>“Then you think they stayed behind to have a look at
the place I found?” Gil said, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Of course; why else would they refuse to go with us?
I knowed trouble was brewin’ from the way they talked
about dividin’ the stuff, an’ perhaps we’ll be gettin’ out
cheap if they take all that’s left. Have you got the diamonds?”</p>

<p>“They are in my breastpocket.”</p>

<p>“Then let ’em go ahead, an’ it ain’t no dead certain
thing that we won’t overhaul ’em before your father
comes back. We’ve got all the weapons, an’ they’ll be in
a tight place if the blacks want to make a rush through
the tunnel. Now, that’s enough for them, an’ we’ll turn
our attention to huntin’ for Andy. Foller me, an’ I’ll
guarantee to find him; but whether it’ll be possible to do
the poor fellow any good is another matter.”</p>

<p>Each of the little party had a revolver, and the total
number of cartridges was sixteen, therefore they could
make quite a spirited fight, provided it was not prolonged.
This fact served to give the boys no slight degree of
courage, and as Jenkins led the way through the underbrush,
where it was so dark that one could not see objects
twenty inches in advance, both felt positive the cook
would be rescued in time.</p>

<p>Although Jenkins appeared to be walking at random,<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
he was in reality pursuing the most direct course possible
for the cave, since it was more than probable the prisoner
had been taken to that stronghold.</p>

<p>After half-an-hour’s rapid traveling the mate halted,
and, parting the branches in front of him, pointed to the
reflection of a fire about fifty yards away.</p>

<p>“That’s where we’ll find cookee, or I’m a Dutchman.
These cattle don’t seem to be able to do anything without
havin’ a big blaze to work by, an’ we’ve only got to crawl
up there in order to see him.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead quickly, or we may be too late.”</p>

<p>“I reckon they’ll take plenty of time to carve him up.
It seems they’re countin’ on catchin’ the whole of us
without much trouble, or else some of ’em would have
been hangin’ around the entrance to the shaft waitin’ for
us to come out.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they didn’t know we were there. It isn’t
safe to trust to chances, and we ought to end matters as
soon as possible.”</p>

<p>Jenkins did not wait to argue further, but continued
the advance cautiously, his companions remaining close
behind him, until they were where it was possible to see
the main body of the enemy.</p>

<p>The number of the blacks had at least been doubled
since the boys saw them last, and that they felt perfectly
secure from an attack could be told by the fact that all
were gathered around an enormous fire, without having
taken the precaution to post sentinels.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the big cave, tied hand and foot, was
poor old Andy. On either side stood a burly black man,<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
whose body was covered with grotesque ornaments, and
the entire party were waiting in silence for the coming of
the old mummers, or, at least, so the boys judged from
the expectant manner in which all gazed toward the entrance.</p>

<p>“If we had a hundred rounds of ammunition, I
wouldn’t be afraid to open fire on the crowd this minute,
an’ it’s ten to one that they’d be cleaned out in twenty
minutes, or made to take to their boats.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t got that number of cartridges, and it
seems to me we had better begin operations mighty soon,
for it’ll be harder after the old fellows are there to urge
the rest on,” Gil suggested, and Nelse expressed the same
opinion by saying:</p>

<p>“Suppose we make a rush? We can fire half-a-dozen
shots at short range, and jump in on them while they
are in confusion.”</p>

<p>“It’s takin’ a big risk,” Jenkins replied, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Of course it is, but we’ve got to run the chances, or
give up all hopes of doing anything.”</p>

<p>It was only natural for Jenkins to hesitate, knowing, as
he did, that Captain Mansfield would hold him responsible
if anything happened to the boys while they were
thus virtually under his charge, but both were so persistent
and impatient that he was forced to act upon their
suggestion or see them start off alone.</p>

<p>“We’ll try it,” he said, with a long-drawn breath; “but
remember, if anything goes wrong, that I advised ag’in a
battle where we’re outnumbered at least ten to one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take it on myself to say you shan’t be blamed, no<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
matter how badly we are beaten,” Gil replied. “Now are
you ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes; have your revolvers in hand. We’ll creep up as
near as we can, an’ when I give the signal each must
shoot as fast as he can till we’ve given ’em three shots
apiece; then make a rush for Andy, an’ if we get hold of
him, make the best time for the shaft. That’ll draw the
whole crowd down on us, an’ we haven’t any water; but
he’ll be safe for a while.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead; we’ll follow. Move quick, for it don’t
improve a fellow’s courage to stand here thinking about
what’s to be done.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A PITCHED BATTLE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was not necessary for the boys to advise Jenkins to
move quickly, since he was quite as eager as they to have
the desperate affair settled.</p>

<p>That he should feel nervous was not to be wondered at,
for he realized fully how many chances there were
against success, and in case of a triumph, bought at the
expense of a dangerous wound to one or the other of the
boys, the mate knew only too well that Captain Mansfield
would bring him to a rigid accounting.</p>

<p>“This is where I’m bound to get the worst of it anyhow,”
he muttered to himself as he crept forward to a
cleared spot, where it would be possible to use the revolver
to advantage, “an’ I don’t know as it makes much
difference how the thing turns out. If we get the best of
it here, we’ve got to settle with the sailors, who, if any
amount of treasure has been found, will be ripe for mischief.”</p>

<p>Then, as if in desperation, he leveled his weapon, gave
the signal for all to be ready, and fired three shots in rapid
succession.</p>

<p>The boys followed his example, except, perhaps, that
they did not take as careful aim, for the idea of shooting,
with intent to kill, at a human being, was, despite the<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
gravity of the situation, something at which their better
nature revolted.</p>

<p>The reports of the weapons rang out in a scattering
fashion, causing it to sound as if ten instead of three men
were firing, and, as the smoke arose, preventing any view
of the enemy, Jenkins shouted:</p>

<p>“Now for it, boys!”</p>

<p>The little party dashed across the cleared space without
knowing what effect the bullets had had.</p>

<p>A cheer went up from Gil as the greater number of the
enemy were seen fleeing into the cave, each man so determined
to gain a place of safety first that the entrance
was literally choked, and those who were prevented from
entering could do no less than turn at bay.</p>

<p>“We’ve frightened ’em too much!” Jenkins cried as he
dashed toward Andy, hoping to sever his bonds while the
blacks were yet panic-stricken, and the words were hardly
spoken when he found his progress barred by two burly
fellows who had come to a halt at the mouth of the
cavern where their companions were packed so closely
that it was impossible for them to take another step forward.</p>

<p>“Look out for Andy!” Jenkins cried, as he raised his
hatchet to ward off a blow aimed at him by a heavy ax.
“I can hold my own here if you’ll attend to him.”</p>

<p>The boys were so excited that they hardly heard the
words, but, since both were aiming for the same object,
the command was involuntarily obeyed.</p>

<p>Lying prostrate on the ground where he had been
overturned by the first frenzied rush, the old man was<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
holding up his hands that the bonds might be severed,
and with one slash of his knife Gil succeeded in cutting
the ropes of grass.</p>

<p>Nelse had fallen over a wounded black as he reached
the prisoner’s side, but he managed to scramble to his feet
and sever the remaining bonds before Gil could do anything
more, and the cook leaped up, and seized a huge
club from a pile of wood near the fire, thus adding one
more to the small numbers of the attacking party.</p>

<p>The boys’ first impulse was to escape with the rescued
man, but a glance toward Jenkins told that he was in sore
need of assistance, and both darted to his side.</p>

<p>The enemy were so active that the mate had not been
able to deal a single blow with any effect, and pressed him
so hotly that he did not have an opportunity to draw his
revolver.</p>

<p>“Shoot that biggest imp!” he shouted, as his friends
gained his side. “I’ll attend to the other!”</p>

<p>Gil aimed directly at the fellow’s head, for it was no
time to hesitate about shedding blood, but before he could
discharge the weapon Andy came to the rescue.</p>

<p>With one swinging blow of his huge club he sent both
the blacks sprawling on the ground, and Jenkins shouted,
as he leaped back:</p>

<p>“Save all your cartridges now, an’ make a dash for the
bushes!”</p>

<p>It was quite time the white party beat a retreat, for the
panic-stricken ones had been turned, probably by the old
men in the cave, and were now returning to the fight.
When they should realize how few were those who made<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
the attack it would hardly be possible to check them, and
Jenkins’ only hope was to gain a shelter before this fact
was known.</p>

<p>So far as could be ascertained in this brief interval of
time, none of the blacks had been killed, but several were
wounded, and these lay on the ground where, unless their
fear was too great, they could see the whites as they ran
toward the bushes.</p>

<p>One of the boldest of those who were returning to the
fray ran after the retreating party with an uplifted ax,
but Jenkins put a bullet through his arm, and he fled once
more, screaming as if in mortal agony, toward the cave,
thus checking the pursuit momentarily.</p>

<p>It was hardly more than three minutes from the time
the first shot was fired before those who had made the
brave charge were within shelter of the foliage, waiting
to regain their breath, and the mate said, in a tone of
deepest relief:</p>

<p>“We’ve come out of that mighty lucky, and now if we
can get to the shaft before they gather their wits, there’s
a chance of pullin’ through all right; but I allow, Andy,
that you’re willin’ to stay with us after this.”</p>

<p>“I’se boun’ to do dat; but I’se gwine ter hol’ to it dat
dere’s no use in stoppin’ whar de hoodoo is mighty
strong.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t strong enough to prevent us from getting
you clear after they had you trussed up like a chicken
ready for roasting,” Gil said, grimly, panting so hard that
he could speak only with difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[209]</span></p>

<p>“Dat’s a fac’, honey; but de charm was wha’ did de
mos’ ob it.”</p>

<p>“You was left alone with your charm, and would have
been killed if we hadn’t followed at risk of our own lives,
so I don’t want to hear any more about that thing,” Nelse
replied, sharply. “If it were of the same power you
seem to think, there would have been no need of us.”</p>

<p>“Dere’s some tings it carn’t do, ob course; but when
you sees it I’se suah you’se gwine ter fall right down
in ’sprise.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you show it to those fellows when
they caught you, an’ saved us all this trouble.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t de time, honey. Dey done cum so quick I
couldn’t mo’n wink afore de ropes was woun’ all ober
me.”</p>

<p>“You managed to make considerable noise, just the
same.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s wha’ I’se boun’ ter do so’s you’se would hyar
me.”</p>

<p>“There’s no use arguin’ with the old fool,” Jenkins said,
impatiently. “We’ve got to get back to the shaft, an’ if
we don’t move mighty lively the whole crowd will be
down on us.”</p>

<p>Even in the face of their danger the boys had allowed
their thoughts to be occupied with the cook to the exclusion
of everything else, and now, as they gazed toward
the fire, it could be seen that the blacks were making ready
for a regular battle.</p>

<p>The repulsive-looking old men had come from the
cave, and were now addressing their followers, probably<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
for the purpose of inciting them to fight, and the more
courageous had already advanced toward the thicket, as
if ready to wreak vengeance.</p>

<p>Four were receiving considerable attention as their
companions bound up the wounds inflicted by the revolvers;
but none were in such a dangerous condition but
that they could give a good account of themselves in the
chase which would probably ensue, and Jenkins said, regretfully:</p>

<p>“We oughter been more careful. What they want is
a good lesson, an’ if we’d succeeded in killin’ half a dozen,
the rest wouldn’t be so bold.”</p>

<p>“We’ve done mischief enough,” Gil said, with a shudder,
“and if we can get back to the tunnel it is to be hoped
they’ll leave us alone.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what they don’t intend to do, my boy.
See! they are after us hot foot already!”</p>

<p>It was as Jenkins had said. The entire crowd were
beginning to move down the slope from the cave, and
there was no longer any hope of being allowed to retire
peacefully.</p>

<p>“It has turned into a runnin’ fight,” the mate said, as
he examined his revolver. “You fellows must start, an’
I’ll try to hold ’em in check a little. Then I’ll join you,
an’ we’ll work the same game over again. Andy, can you
lead the way to the shaft?”</p>

<p>“I’se able ter do dat much.”</p>

<p>“Then go, and don’t wait for me until I’ve fired three
times. After that I shall come on the best I know how.”</p>

<p>The old man started through the underbrush after assuring<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
himself that the boys were close behind, and during
the next five minutes the three traveled at a rapid
pace without hearing the slightest sound from the rear.</p>

<p>Then came two shots in succession, and Gil would have
stopped but that the old darky reminded him they should
hear another before coming to a halt, and in less than a
minute the third rang out so near at hand that it seemed
as if Jenkins must have been standing close beside them
when he fired.</p>

<p>“Where are you?” Nelse cried, and the mate replied:</p>

<p>“Don’t speak so loud. They are right behind, and our
only hope is to throw them off the scent, or we may not
be able to get under cover.”</p>

<p>“Even if we gain the shaft it is only a question of being
starved out.”</p>

<p>“Very true; but we can stand considerable hunger an’
thirst before we’ll come out to be killed.”</p>

<p>Now it was Jenkins who led the way, and he traveled
at full speed until the footsteps of the pursuers could be
heard close in the rear, when he halted.</p>

<p>“Go on, boys; I’ll try to stop ’em once more, an’ on the
next tack we must sight the shaft, or give up all hope of
gettin’ back there.”</p>

<p>“Come on, chillun! Don’t stop now when dem
debbils are so nigh!” Andy shouted, and in another instant
a cry of terror burst from his lips as he ran almost
into the arms of a black man.</p>

<p>The devotees of voudooism were not so dumb as the
mate had fancied, and instead of following behind, a portion<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
had circled around the party, thus cutting off the line
of the proposed retreat.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go on?” Jenkins cried, angrily.</p>

<p>“Because they have succeeded in surrounding us,” Gil
replied, but by no means calmly. “It’s a question of fighting,
now, whether we want to or not.”</p>

<p>“Then be careful that every shot tells,” the mate cried,
taking no heed of the fact that in the intense darkness it
was impossible to do more than fire at random.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">UNDER COVER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In an instant every one of the fugitives realized that
perfect silence was of the utmost importance in aiding
them to ascertain the location of the enemy, and not one
moved or spoke during the minute which followed the
alarming discovery.</p>

<p>Then could be heard the stealthy footsteps of those
who were tracking them to the death, and Jenkins fancied
he saw a way out of the dangerous situation.</p>

<p>Pressing the hand of Nelse, who was nearest, he intimated
that the boy was to follow him, and the latter, in
turn, communicated the command by the same means to
Gil and Andy.</p>

<p>The mate’s purpose was to steal off at an angle, and
thus avoid the enemy, who was steadily closing in on
them, for a hand-to-hand conflict was not to be thought
of for a single instant, and that was what must come in
a very short time, unless the pursued could escape the net
which was being drawn tighter each moment.</p>

<p>Stealthily the four crept toward the left, advancing
slowly but surely each instant until, just when all began
to fancy the plan might be a success, it was Jenkins’ turn
to run plump into the arms of one of the enemy.</p>

<p>During a few seconds neither of his companions understood<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
why he halted so suddenly, nor what caused the
unusual rustling among the foliage, and then Gil realized,
more by the sense of touch than of sight, that the mate
was putting forth all his strength in a struggle for the
mastery, the loser of which might expect only death.</p>

<p>For an instant it seemed singular that the black did not
summon others to his aid, and then Gil learned that the
sailor had grasped his adversary by the throat, thus preventing
him from making any outcry.</p>

<p>Once this discovery had been made, the only question
was as to how the mate might be assisted, and Gil could
think of no way, except to seize the man by the legs, which
he did with such suddenness and strength that the fellow
was hurled to the ground, his head striking an uncovered
root a resounding thump that deprived him of consciousness.</p>

<p>Now was the time to continue the flight, for every second
was precious, and the little party pushed on through
the underbrush at a rate of speed that promised to give
them a decided advantage over possible pursuers.</p>

<p>At the best pace each ran, Jenkins leading the way,
the others following in single file, each grasping the clothing
of the one in advance that they might not be separated.
The blows received by coming in contact with the low-hanging
branches were not noticed in this race for life,
nor did any heed the dangers that might be encountered
by a misstep, or a mistake as to the course; but all pressed
on literally for dear life, and when twenty minutes had
passed Jenkins paused at the mouth of the shaft.</p>

<p>Not a sound could be heard to betoken that the enemy<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
were in pursuit, and the mate was on the point of whispering
to the sailors to pass up the rope, when Gil said:</p>

<p>“Here it is, made fast to the tree as when we left.”</p>

<p>“And they were so crazy about the treasure that it
wasn’t thought worth while to look out for safety. It
would have been a nice mess, if those imps had come here
ahead of us, an’ taken a notion to find the meaning of such
a ladder.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that now,” Gil said, soothingly, as he saw
that the mate was likely to linger too long over this neglect
of duty. “Let’s get below first, and talk about what
should have been done afterward.”</p>

<p>“Go down; I’ll wait until you are at the bottom, so’s to
make sure the black villains haven’t yet discovered our
hiding-place.”</p>

<p>Gil swung himself over the edge, and allowed the rope
to slip slowly through his hands until he reached the
bottom.</p>

<p>Neither of the two men came to ask the result of the
foray, and he thought with surprise that they must be
sleeping.</p>

<p>It was necessary every member of the party should be
on the alert, and he went into the tunnel to awaken them,
feeling around with his hands.</p>

<p>Nothing could be found. It was as if the place had
been abandoned. Pressing farther in he continued the
blind search, but without success, and finally the truth
of the matter flashed upon him. Running to the shaft,
arriving there just as Jenkins descended, the others having
reached the bottom in safety, he said, excitedly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[216]</span></p>

<p>“The sailors have gone to help us, and now I suppose
we ought to start out to find them, though it seems like
advertising our whereabouts to the enemy.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that neither of the fellows are here?”
Jenkins asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Not unless they are in the treasure chamber. I went
up the tunnel as far as I dared without a light, and found
it empty. I suppose they thought we were getting the
worst of it when the firing was heard, and wanted to
help.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” the mate said, angrily. “They’ve been
overhaulin’ the treasure; taken all they could find, an’
now propose to give us the slip.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem reasonable they would run so many
risks just for a little money.”</p>

<p>“The chances are that they’ve found a good deal, and
rather than divide, or be contented with what the captain
might choose to give them, have parted company
with us.”</p>

<p>“That seems like suicide, for they can’t show themselves
when father arrives without giving up what has
been carried away.”</p>

<p>“Most likely they count on stealin’ a boat from the
blacks, an’ gettin’ to the mainland; but they’ll find that a
mighty slim chance. I wish I had hold of the sneaks
for a minute, I’d show them what it means to play such
a trick.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother your head about it. We are well rid of
men who will act like that.”</p>

<p>“But they’ve made way with all the treasure you discovered,<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
most likely,” and in his anger Jenkins spoke incautiously
loud.</p>

<p>“What of it? The chances are neither they nor we can
leave the island with it, and our lives are more precious
than all the pirates’ hoards that were ever buried.”</p>

<p>The mate failed to look at the matter in such a philosophical
light, and he would have continued to give way
to his anger in unmeasured terms, if a noise from the entrance
had not warned him to be silent.</p>

<p>Animated by the same thought, each member of the
party crept to the edge of the shaft, and there the hum of
voices proclaimed that the secret of their hiding-place had
been discovered.</p>

<p>“We’re under cover now, for a fact,” Jenkins said,
grimly, as the sound of footsteps told that the enemy were
moving to and fro, evidently for the purpose of examining
the surroundings, “and the worst of it is that we’re reg’larly
shut in till the captain comes back, for I’ll guarantee
that crowd don’t leave while we are down here alive.”</p>

<p>“Then the sailors are better off than we, and have a
good chance to get hold of the boats.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t likely these imps are so careless as to leave the
crafts where anybody can get them, an’ we shall have to
wait till mornin’ before knowin’ who’s in the best condition.
We’ll have a few oysters, an’ then try to get a little
sleep, for there’s no danger of an attack between now
an’ daylight.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t close my eyes a single minute while that
crowd is waiting around to kill us,” Nelse said, with a
shudder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t be so sure, lad; you’ll get used to it in a little
while, an’ the need for sleep will come mighty strong
before morning.”</p>

<p>Nelse was positive Jenkins spoke at random, and he
also thought he couldn’t eat anything under the circumstances;
but when his companions attacked the oysters
he succeeded in swallowing quite as many as did Gil, and
even Andy made a hearty supper.</p>

<p>It was no longer possible to hear any noise from
around the mouth of the shaft; but the besieged knew beyond
a doubt that the enemy were still there, and, acting
upon the mate’s suggestion, all hands moved a short distance
inside the tunnel, where they could talk without
danger of being overheard.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, every one was anxious to hear
the story of Andy’s adventures, and he was able to tell
it in a very few words.</p>

<p>After refusing to enter the tunnel with the remainder
of the party, the old man had made his way toward the interior
of the island, hoping to find a hiding-place in some
of the trees, and succeeded only in losing his way.</p>

<p>After walking nearly an hour, he found himself in
sight of the big cave where the blacks were assembled in
full force, and this so frightened him that he thought only
of trying to find his comrades. To that end he struck out
in the direction where he supposed the shaft to be located,
and was within a few yards of the desired spot when he
was seized by five men.</p>

<p>From that moment until the revolvers were discharged,
Andy had no hope anything could be done to aid him,<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
and, losing faith for the first time in his mysterious charm,
prepared for death.</p>

<p>It was evident from the manner of telling the story
that he did not care to go into the details, after having
brought the trouble all on himself, and a remark made
by Gil relative to the treasure-chamber gave him a good
excuse for changing the topic of conversation.</p>

<p>“Am it sure dem men took all de gol’ dere was in de
hole?” he asked, and Nelse said, with some slight show of
enthusiasm:</p>

<p>“What’s to prevent us from finding out exactly the
condition of affairs? We’ve got to stay here, and an examination
of the place will serve to make the time pass
more quickly.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we might be needed here suddenly,” Gil suggested;
but Jenkins said, decidedly:</p>

<p>“I’ll guarantee there’ll be nothin’ goin’ on in this part
of the island till sunrise, so if you feel disposed to have
a look at the place after them scoundrels have got away
with the treasure, there’s nothing to prevent.”</p>

<p>“Somebody will have to help us down. I wouldn’t
want to try to lower Nelse alone.”</p>

<p>“Andy can attend to that part of the business. Let him
stand by the rope, an’, in case anything should happen
which ain’t probable, I can pass the word to him.”</p>

<p>“Is yer gwine ter keep right on lookin’ fur de pirates’
gol’?” the old man asked, in evident alarm.</p>

<p>“Yes, we want to see if the men have left any.”</p>

<p>“Den I stays right hyar. We’se done had trubble enuff
’bout dat ar’ money, an’ I wants ter keep ’way frum it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[220]</span></p>

<p>It was in vain that the boys and Jenkins alternately
coaxed and scolded; the old fellow positively refused to so
much as take a single step into the tunnel, and it seemed
as if the investigations would necessarily be postponed
until a more convenient season.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A SECOND ALARM.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The old darky’s superstitious fears sometimes resembled
stubbornness, as in this particular case, and Gil,
after exhausting his powers of persuasion without effect,
said impatiently:</p>

<p>“It’s mighty strange that you’re always afraid when
there’s something on hand in the shape of work.”</p>

<p>“Cummin’ to dis yere islan’ wasn’ none ob my fixin’, an’
ef de captin would er lef’ me I’d done been gone outer de
yacht afore she got pas’ New York Harbor, kase I
knowed wha’ was goin’ ter happen,” and then Andy relapsed
into moody silence.</p>

<p>The fact that they could not examine the treasure-chamber
caused the boys the most intense desire to do so,
and finally Nelse suggested that they try it alone.</p>

<p>“I’ll contrive to lower you down, Gil, an’ Mr. Jenkins
can come into the tunnel long enough to help pull you
out.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a better plan than that,” the mate said, suddenly,
as a happy thought occurred to him. “Andy shall
stay here to listen for the blacks, an’ I’ll bear a hand.
After you’ve been there long enough I can come after
you.”</p>

<p>“I’se willin’ to stan’ watch ef all hands wants ter go,”<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
Andy added, gruffly, and thus the matter was settled, although
it would be necessary for Jenkins to remain in the
tunnel.</p>

<p>The old darky seated himself with his back against the
side of the shaft, a very dangerous position if any of the
enemy should descend quickly, and the others commenced
operations.</p>

<p>The torches were found in the tunnel where they had
been dropped when Andy’s cry for help was heard, and,
as he ignited one, Jenkins said:</p>

<p>“Now have a good look around, boys, an’ make sure
them thieves didn’t leave anything behind.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps there was nothing but the diamonds in the
hole,” Nelse suggested.</p>

<p>“I don’t allow pirates would go to the trouble of diggin’
sich a place for the sake of hidin’ a little thing like that.
Have you still got them safe, Gil?”</p>

<p>“Trust me for that. Even while we were stealing up
on the enemy, I kept feeling in my pocket to make sure
they couldn’t get lost.”</p>

<p>“I allow there’s more than enough in them ’ere stones
to pay for the <em>Day Dream</em>, an’ leave some over to tassel
our handkerchiefs with. Now, are you ready?”</p>

<p>While they were speaking, Jenkins had been uncoiling
the rope, and began to fasten one end under Gil’s arms as
he spoke.</p>

<p>Then, lifting the boy clear from the ground, he let him
drop slowly to the bottom with the torch in his hand.</p>

<p>The same operation was repeated with Nelse, and the<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
two had ample opportunity to examine the subterranean
chamber.</p>

<p>It had been built with exceeding care. The sides,
which were cut in a coral ledge, as was the entire excavation,
had been chiseled smooth, an operation which must
have required no slight amount of time, and in the roof
were what appeared to be two small apertures for the
escape of air.</p>

<p>These details, however, were not noted by the boys
until they had been in the cavern some time. Their first,
and, in fact, only thought was of the supposed treasure.</p>

<p>The large amount of earth which had fallen when
Gil was precipitated into the chamber, covered one end
of the apartment entirely, and the fact of this having been
thrown around considerably told that it had been overhauled
to a considerable extent since Gil was drawn up,
while the fragments of what he believed to be a box were
scattered in every direction.</p>

<p>“There’s no question but that the men have been here,”
Nelse said, sufficiently loud for Jenkins, who was lying
over the aperture in such a manner that he could both
hear and see, to distinguish the words.</p>

<p>“Of course they have,” the mate replied, angrily, “an’
that’s why they wouldn’t come with us to help Andy. Do
you see anything?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more than this pile of dirt,” Gil replied. “If
the spade is in the shaft we might throw it all over, an’
make sure they got everything.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea. Wait a minute an’ I’ll fetch it.”</p>

<p>Jenkins’ face disappeared from the aperture, and while<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
he was absent the boys had a good opportunity to survey
the singular place. In addition to what has already been
spoken of, they noted with no small degree of surprise,
that the remains of a stone stairway occupied one corner
of the chamber, and immediately above it was a portion
of a wooden hatch or trapdoor set in the earth by iron
bands.</p>

<p>It was directly in the center of this, where the wood
had decayed, that Gil fell, and the wonder was that he did
not strike on the steps, in which case the mishap might
have had a more unpleasant ending.</p>

<p>“All I can say is that the pirates must have had a lot of
spare time on their hands, if they went to all the trouble
necessary to make a place like this just to bury their
treasure, when it would have been safer buried in the
earth where a fellow couldn’t fall through by mistake, as
you did,” Nelse said, laughingly. “It looks as if some one
had the idea of living here.”</p>

<p>Before Gil could reply Jenkins arrived with the spade,
and he said, as the implement was dropped on the loose
earth:</p>

<p>“Better make a thorough search, boys, an’ if you think
the work is likely to be too hard, come back, an’ I’ll go
down.”</p>

<p>“We’ll attend to it. It can’t take such a very long
time to get at the bottom,” Gil replied, as he began the
task.</p>

<p>During five minutes of rapid work nothing was disclosed;
but at the end of that time Gil unearthed a bench<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
which had been crushed by the falling earth, and after
that the discoveries came thick and fast.</p>

<p>Fragments of chairs, a mass of decaying matter which
appeared to have been wearing apparel, rusty cooking implements,
and, finally, in one corner, a low writing desk
was found.</p>

<p>As the last-mentioned article was unearthed the boys
gave vent to a cry of triumph, and Gil shouted excitedly:</p>

<p>“Here’s where we shall find the gold that the sailors
overlooked.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re makin’ a mistake about that, my boy,”
Jenkins replied, in a thoughtful tone. “It looks to me as
if this place was used to live in, an’ most likely what
treasure the people had who built the place was in the
chest you fell on. If there were diamonds in it, the gold
was there to a dead certainty, an’ we shan’t see anything
more in the way of valuables.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take long to find out what is in here,” and Gil
struck the ancient desk a heavy blow with the spade,
causing it to fall in fragments.</p>

<p>At this instant the torch was extinguished, the wood
having been consumed, and the eager explorers were
forced to wait until Jenkins could make and send down
another.</p>

<p>Now they searched carefully among the fragments, and
the first article found was a metal casket covered with
rust, and securely locked.</p>

<p>“Here’s what we want!” Gil cried, triumphantly, as he
held it above his head that the mate might have a full
view. “When this is opened we shall see a pile of gold!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>“It doesn’t appear to be very heavy.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. I never thought of that,” was the reply,
in a tone of disappointment, and Gil tried in vain to open
the box by striking it with the spade.</p>

<p>“Use this!” and Jenkins threw down one of the hatchets.</p>

<p>Even with such an effective implement it was not an
easy matter to break the casket; but the metal finally
yielded after repeated blows, and the boys gazed at the
exposed contents in dismay.</p>

<p>Instead of treasure, they had unearthed nothing more
than a lot of time-stained documents and Gil was about
to throw them away when Jenkins called sharply:</p>

<p>“Pass them up here. We’ll have a look at the writin’
first, an’ then’ll be plenty of time to say they are worth
nothing. What else was there in the desk?”</p>

<p>Again the boys resumed the search; but it seemed as
if all the important contents of the chamber had been
exposed to view.</p>

<p>Several tiny vials; some curious instruments, which
might once have belonged to a surgeon, and a package
of quills for pens, comprised the entire list of articles.</p>

<p>The loose earth had been examined thoroughly, and
Gil said with a sigh of disappointment:</p>

<p>“There’s no reason why we should stay here any longer.
It’s too hot down here for comfort, and we can look at the
papers up above where there’s more air.”</p>

<p>“All right, here’s the rope. Send the iron box first, an’
then I’ll pull you out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[227]</span></p>

<p>Five minutes later the boys were in the tunnel, and
since there could be no question but that the sailors had
succeeded in getting the greater portion of the treasure,
the contents of the casket attracted considerable attention.</p>

<p>“Let’s go up a long bit where there’s no danger the light
of the torch can be noticed from the shaft, an’ see what’s
written on all that paper,” Gil suggested, and Jenkins
ran back to tell Andy of the change of position before following
the boys to a point within twenty or thirty feet
from the stone door which had been discovered some time
previous.</p>

<p>Here the three seated themselves on the ground, and
the mate was about to take the yellow documents from
their long resting-place, when the torch was suddenly extinguished
without apparent cause.</p>

<p>Nelse was on the point of making some laughing remark,
when he felt the mate’s hand pressed firmly over his
mouth, and at the same instant a draught of air swept
down the passage as if a vent had suddenly been opened.</p>

<p>Motioning for the boys to follow his example, Jenkins
rose to his feet, and as he did so it was possible to see a
tiny thread of light from the end of the tunnel, where,
a moment previous, had been only the most profound
darkness.</p>

<p>There was no need now to speculate as to why the torch
had been extinguished.</p>

<p>The blacks had discovered, even if they did not know it
before, that the cave communicated with the tunnel, and<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
were about to creep upon the white party, hoping to take
them by surprise.</p>

<p>The supreme moment had come, and the three who
stood in that gloomy place listening for the sounds which
should tell that the enemy was advancing, knew it was
to be a struggle to the finish.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN THE TUNNEL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>During several moments Jenkins remained motionless,
as if trying to decide what course to pursue, and the boys
bent forward in their efforts to hear the first sound which
should come from the direction of that ray of light; but
nothing broke the almost profound silence, save their own
labored breathing.</p>

<p>“They are goin’ to take plenty of time about it, an’
we’ll do the same,” Jenkins whispered, cautiously, with
his mouth close to Gil’s ear. “The idiots think the light
don’t show through, an’ are tryin’ to find out if we’re in
the tunnel.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to be done? We can’t stand here till they
come.”</p>

<p>“Take off your shoes, an’ we’ll steal down to the shaft.
We mustn’t make a stand here, for it ain’t certain a lot
of ’em won’t come in from the outside at the same time.”</p>

<p>In their stockinged feet the three crept softly down the
passage, hugging the left side to avoid being precipitated
into the excavation, until they arrived at the point where
Andy, clutching firmly the “charm” on his bosom, was
keeping watch.</p>

<p>In reply to Jenkins’ whispered questions, he declared
that nothing larger than a night bird had moved in the<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
vicinity, and on being told of what was occurring at the
opposite end of the tunnel, would have leaped to his feet
with a cry of alarm but for the firm hold the mate had
upon him.</p>

<p>“Sit still, an keep your wits about you while I creep
back a short distance,” the latter whispered. “If you
make a noise, or try to kick up any bobbery because you
don’t like our way of managin’ things, I’ll shoot you as
quick as I would one of them voudoo-dancin’ black men.”</p>

<p>This threat was sufficient to reduce Andy to a state of
complete submission; but it destroyed his usefulness as a
watcher, for he was no longer in a frame of mind where
he could distinguish between a genuine noise and his
own imagination.</p>

<p>“Be ready to shoot the first heathen who shows his
head,” the mate said to Gil, and then he disappeared in
the tunnel.</p>

<p>It was useless to expect any assistance from Andy, and
the boys stood at the foot of the shaft listening intently,
with their revolvers ready for use; but nothing save the
sighing of the night wind among the foliage came to their
ears.</p>

<p>The mate moved as noiselessly as a shadow, and the
silence was almost terrifying.</p>

<p>The minutes passed like hours, fearing as the boys did
that each instant would come the sounds of conflict, proclaiming
that they must begin the struggle for life, and
fully half-an-hour had passed before Jenkins appeared,
saying in a low, hurried tone, as he stood beside Gil and
Nelse:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[231]</span></p>

<p>“They have started. I counted six before the door was
closed, an’ they’ll be here in about five minutes. Our best
plan is to hug the wall of the shaft close by the entrance
to the tunnel, an’ wait till they are at close range, when
every shot will count.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do whatever you think best,” Gil replied, nervously,
and the mate continued:</p>

<p>“We can’t fight very long with the small number of
cartridges, so each one must bring down a man. If the
fellows from the top join in, as I reckon they’re bound to
do, keep far enough inside to prevent them from seeing
the flash of the powder, an’ take to your hatchets when the
last shot has been fired. It’s better to die here fightin’
than allow ourselves to be taken prisoners for their pleasure.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our share,” Gil said, “and now I shan’t hesitate
to try to kill a human being.”</p>

<p>“It’s your life or theirs, an’ you’d be foolish to have any
scruples now. I’ve brought the iron box here in case
there should be a chance of gettin’ out of this place; but
I don’t s’pose we’ll have any call for it, because there are
too many blacks for us to get the best of in a fair fight.”</p>

<p>Jenkins ceased speaking very suddenly, for at that moment
a rustling of the leaves was heard from the top of
the shaft, and all expected the onslaught would be made at
once.</p>

<p>Even Andy understood it was a question of fighting,
and that his charm would not avail him at such a time,
therefore he joined the defenders, although he had no
weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>One, two, three minutes passed, and to the boys it
seemed as if every drop of blood in their bodies was literally
boiling with excitement. Their mouths became
parched, and each tried in vain to moisten his burning lips,
as he mentally braced himself for the coming struggle.</p>

<p>The suspense was worse than reality, and only with the
greatest difficulty could Gil prevent himself from shrieking
to break the awful silence. Five minutes more passed,
and it seemed as if fully half-an-hour must have elapsed
when the little party were absolutely electrified by hearing
a blood-curdling cry from the forest, which was echoed
and re-echoed by the trees until one could have sworn
a hundred men were in their last agonies.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant the sound of footsteps came
from the tunnel, and before the boys could draw their
weapons, it was succeeded by a cry of distress from a
dozen throats.</p>

<p>Then all was still once more.</p>

<p>Nelse turned toward Jenkins as if to ask whether this
had simply been a trick of the imagination, and then came
a cry of terror from the tunnel, repeated again and again
until the air was filled with the hideous noise.</p>

<p>What it could mean no one knew, and as Andy cowered
in mortal terror against the side of the shaft, Jenkins
saw a human form outlined upon the lighter darkness of
the opening.</p>

<p>Raising his revolver he fired, and a heavy body fell to
the ground almost at their feet.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” Gil asked, unable longer to remain
silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<p>“I’m blest if I know. Anyhow, here’s one of the villains,
an’, what’s worse, he ain’t dead.”</p>

<p>Again a tumult in the tunnel was heard, and Nelse
cried:</p>

<p>“The fellows who were trying to surprise us have fallen
into the underground chamber. So much is certain; but
what’s the meaning of that?” and he stopped for an instant
as the shrieks from the forest rang out again in
such a tone of agony there could no longer be any question
that a human soul was being sent to its final account.</p>

<p>The terrifying cries died away in the distance, even as
the little party listened, and once more silence reigned,
save when the wounded mass of humanity gave vent to a
groan.</p>

<p>Unless one believed in voudooism as did Andy, everything
was incomprehensible, and even the old darky could
think of no satisfactory explanation just at this moment,
for he cowered close to the others, shaking like one in an
ague fit, and clutching with the strength of despair at
the mysterious “something” concealed beneath his shirt.</p>

<p>One, two, three minutes more passed, and then Jenkins
said, with a long-drawn breath:</p>

<p>“I can’t stand this sort of thing any longer, boys.
We’re bound to find out what’s been goin’ on, an’ the facts
can’t be any worse than a fellow’s imagination as he
stands here shiverin’.”</p>

<p>The boys would have followed him as he went into the
tunnel, but he prevented them by saying:</p>

<p>“Stay here, an’ keep a mighty sharp watch. Nobody<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
knows but that all this yellin’ was done to throw us off
our guard.”</p>

<p>“I’m certain those noises couldn’t have been made for
effect, an’ you’ll find a whole crowd in the place where
the diamonds came from,” Nelse replied, in a decided
tone.</p>

<p>“Then all the more reason why some one should be
there to prevent them from crawlin’ out. I can take care
of a good many, if they’re in that trap; but we are bound
to watch out for all the chances.”</p>

<p>Jenkins was so reckless as to light a match before he
was more than a dozen feet inside the tunnel, and a moment
after the boys saw a glow, telling that he had ignited
one of the torches.</p>

<p>From the outside not a sound came, and in a few seconds
the boys heard the mate’s cheery cry:</p>

<p>“You were right, Nelse. The whole boilin’ of ’em are
in here like rats, an’ believe I’m goin’ to kill ’em.”</p>

<p>“Can you see them?” Gil asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Of course I can, as well as if the whole lot were on
exhibition in a dime museum. One of you come here an
take a peep, for there’s no question now but that some
of their plans have gone wrong.”</p>

<p>Nelse ran into the tunnel in response to this invitation,
and on reaching the hole saw seven black forms crouching
at the bottom in deepest terror, while Jenkins was amusing
himself by walking around the edge of the excavation
throwing the light on the huddling mass, and threatening<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
the poor wretches with what he proposed doing when
it should be convenient.</p>

<p>“Do you think it is just safe to stand here while more
of the party can jump in on you by the same way these
came?” Nelse asked, and this question put a very sudden
end to the mate’s sport.</p>

<p>“Wait while I have a look around,” he said, as he
handed the torch to the boy and disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>Before Nelse could explain the cause of his delay to Gil,
the mate returned, saying, in a tone of satisfaction:</p>

<p>“They’ve shut the door tight, to keep us out in case
these fellows failed, I reckon, an’ it won’t be a bad idea
for me to keep watch there while you an’ Gil divide the
work here. We must stop any nonsense at the beginnin’,
an’ then they can’t get the upper hands of us.”</p>

<p>“Is there a real necessity of watching this crowd?”</p>

<p>“Of course; otherwise they could soon manage to wriggle
out by climbin’ on each other’s shoulders. Stand by
and shoot the first who rises to his feet,” Jenkins replied,
and then he added, in a stern tone to the trembling blacks,
as if believing they could understand him: “Don’t you
so much as move, or we’ll kill the whole boilin’ the same
as we would mosquitoes. Lay down, an’ the first one who
raises his head shall serve as an example for the rest.”</p>

<p>It was evident that the fellows understood the purport
of his words, for they crouched yet lower, and he added
to Nelse:</p>

<p>“Don’t hesitate to shoot if they make any show of<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
tryin’ to get out, for our lives depend upon holdin’ the
whole crowd.”</p>

<p>“You ought to tell Gil where I am.”</p>

<p>“He’s got sense enough to know that at such a time as
this he must remain at his post, so do as I tell you, an’
don’t take your eyes off the gang for a single minute.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE STORY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nelse did as he was bidden; but while standing at the
edge of the excavation holding the torch in one hand and
his revolver in the other, he could not fail to realize
how quickly the tables might be turned if the blacks
should make a combined dash.</p>

<p>That which held them in subjection was the fact that
the walls of the underground chamber were so high they
could not gain the floor of the tunnel without climbing
on each other’s shoulders, and while this was being done
the sentinel would have ample opportunity to shoot with
reasonable accuracy of aim.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gil was straining his ears for the repetition
of that fearful noise which had literally caused the blood
to chill in his veins, and Andy remained crouching within
the shadow of the tunnel busily engaged in executing a
series of wonderful contortions evidently intended as an
incantation to weaken the power of the voudoo
worshipers.</p>

<p>During fully half an hour matters remained in this condition,
not a sound save the usual night noises of the forest
breaking the silence, and then the old darky, his alleged
spell having been wrought, came toward Gil as he
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<p>“I’se gwine ter take my trick at standin’ watch, an’
you’se kin fin’ de odders.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take much hunting to do that, for I reckon
they are guarding the other end of the tunnel; but, if you
can attend to matters here for a while, I’ll be glad to see
how things are getting on.”</p>

<p>“I’se done gone fixed myself,” was the grave reply, and
Gil naturally came to the conclusion that the “fixing” was
neither more nor less than those wonderful contortions in
which the old darky had been indulging.</p>

<p>Nelse was more than pleased at seeing his friend, for
the mental strain of watching over so many of the enemy
was beginning to tell upon him, and, what seemed more
important, the torch was nearly consumed.</p>

<p>“Stand here a while and I’ll make another,” he said,
glad of any excuse which should take him from the
chamber, with its frightened, cowering occupants, and
Gil readily agreed to shoulder the responsibility.</p>

<p>To recount all that took place on this eventful night
would be tedious. It suffices to say that a strict watch
was kept at each point from which danger might be anticipated,
and when morning came every member of the
party felt thoroughly worn out and exhausted.</p>

<p>Jenkins had but little fear an attack would be made during
the day, except it might be from the farther end of
the tunnel, and proposed to run the risk of this by withdrawing
the sentinel from that point and stationing him
at the underground chamber, where his duty would be to
stand watch over the entire tunnel.</p>

<p>“In that way we shall all get a chance to sleep, which is<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
what we’re needin’ mighty bad, an’ I’ll take the first trick.
Andy shall stay near the shaft, an’ you boys are to have a
good two-hour snooze.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me that the torches won’t hold out a great
while longer,” Nelse said, as he looked ruefully at the
small supply of wood, which had diminished rapidly since
the blacks were caught in the trap.</p>

<p>“We won’t worry about that. Time enough when we’ve
used the last one. The important thing is to get some
rest, an’ I want you boys to begin without delay so’s Andy
an’ I can have our turn.”</p>

<p>Despite the fact that they had thought it would be impossible
to close their eyes in slumber, while in a situation
of such peril, the boys had hardly stretched themselves
out on the floor of the tunnel before they were
sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>Not until three hours later did either awaken, and then
the mate aroused them with a cheery cry of:</p>

<p>“All hands on deck!”</p>

<p>To their great surprise they saw the shaft comfortably
full of black men, and Jenkins said, in reply to their questions:</p>

<p>“Andy an’ I did that while you were snoring. We
found out that the fellows in the treasure-chamber could
understand a kind of lingo he talks, an’ then we made ’em
know what was wanted. We brought ’em up here one
by one, after tyin’ the hands of each with that string-piece
he wore around his waist, an’ now they’re quiet an’ harmless
as lambs. None of ’em dares to wink very hard, an’
we can do all the watchin’ at this place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[240]</span></p>

<p>“Ain’t you afraid they will make a sudden rush?” Nelse
asked, thinking it anything rather than safe to allow the
fellows so near.</p>

<p>“Not while their hands are tied, an’ one of us manages
to keep awake. They know what the result will be if
any of ’em so much as moves his head the wrong way, an’
I reckon they’ll stay quiet enough.”</p>

<p>“But what about the door at the other end of the tunnel?”</p>

<p>“I’m takin’ my chances on that ’cause we’ve dug away
the earth at the top of the treasure-chamber, an’ it’ll be a
mighty smart darky who can crawl along there without
tumblin’ in, seein’s they can’t afford to bring a light with
’em. You see, this does away with the trouble about
torches, an’ I’ll admit that I don’t know how we could
a-got more when these were used up. Now, I’m goin’ to
take about forty winks. Andy has been right there for
the last hour, so you can turn him out for the next trick.”</p>

<p>As he lay down, Jenkins motioned toward the mouth
of the tunnel, where the cook was sleeping with his huge
mouth opened to its widest extent, and it seemed to the
boys as if the former had but just stretched himself out
when he was aiding Andy in the snoring concert.</p>

<p>Some of the prisoners had so far recovered from their
fears as to be able to indulge in slumber, and those who
remained awake were doing their best to convince the
watchers that their intentions were peaceable.</p>

<p>Although the situation was decidedly improved from
what it had been when the boys lay down, it was yet<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
far from being reassuring, and not until ten minutes or
more had passed did they feel at all comfortable in mind.</p>

<p>Then Gil said, as he saw the iron casket lying near the
entrance, where Jenkins had placed it for safe keeping:</p>

<p>“I think it’s about time we examined those documents.
You keep your eyes on the fellows, an’ I’ll find out what’s
written there.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead; but I don’t believe you’ll have much luck,
for most likely it’s in French or Spanish, an’ we ain’t very
well posted in those languages, although we might have
been by studying a little harder.”</p>

<p>“It’s English!” Gil exclaimed, in a tone of satisfaction,
as he drew the stained documents from their long
resting-place, and forced to use the greatest caution in
opening them lest the paper, brittle with age, should be
destroyed.</p>

<p>“If you read it, go on, an’ I’ll keep my eyes on this
crowd of very interesting young gentlemen,” Nelse said,
as he settled himself into a more comfortable position for
listening, and displayed his revolver ostentatiously.</p>

<p>“The writing is plain enough, except in places where
the ink has faded, and I reckon I can get through with it,
so here goes for the first sheet.”</p>

<p>“How many are there?”</p>

<p>“Seven or eight; but the most of them appear to be
memoranda of business transactions, for all except the
first are covered with figures. It starts off like a will:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I, Nissage Boyer, native of France, and adopted citizen of
the United States, owner of the finest plantation on the island of
Hayti, and lessee of the government forest containing the most<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
valuable dye-wood, deposit here a memoranda of my possessions
in case I should never succeed in leaving this place alive, hoping
it may fall into the hands of my family, who, fortunately, are
now safe in New York.</p>

<p>“During the past year I have done my best to keep out of
political entanglements; but Soulouque, who capers like a
crowned monkey under his borrowed name of Faustin I., has laid
many traps, some of which I have fallen into, and, in order to
retain possession of my property, and at the same time send my
family to a place of safety, I bound myself to his falling fortunes.
Now, in the year 1857 I find myself threatened both by the emperor
and insurgents. Trying to serve two masters, I have fallen
to the ground, and am a fugitive, trusting to the fidelity of my
slaves, and seeking an opportunity to set sail for the United
States.</p>

<p>“Condemned to death by both parties, I should have been executed
several days ago but for some of my negroes, who aided
me to reach this island, where I fitted up a place of refuge in
the year Soulouque declared himself emperor, knowing full well
that the evil times would soon come, and hoping this might
serve as a hiding-place for my dear ones. The shaft, the tunnel
and the main cave were probably built by the buccaneers who
settled here in 1702; but the voudoo worshipers have made the
island their abiding-place so long that none of the negroes and
few white men care to visit it.</p>

<p>“Protected by these same voudoo priests, who have always
done all in their power to frighten their countrymen away from
this place, I am awaiting the arrival of a fisherman’s vessel
which should be here in a week at the outside, unless the situation
at the capital becomes so grave that all the sailing crafts will
be seized by the alleged emperor or the so-called insurgents. I
have succeeded in bringing away the most valuable of my personal
property, and, in addition, a necklace of diamonds for
which I sold the contents of a warehouse, taking them in exchange,
since gold is not readily gotten hold of without exciting
suspicion that the owner wishes to leave the island.</p>

<p>“The stones, together with as much money as I have been able
to secrete, will remain in this subterranean chamber&mdash;&mdash;”</p></div>

<p>“Look here,” Nelse cried, interrupting Gil, “according
to what you’ve been reading we haven’t found any pirates’<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
treasure, but something for which an owner may appear
at any moment.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the size of it, and when we give up the
diamonds we sha’n’t be able to account very satisfactorily
for what the sailors stole. Our story will seem rather
fishy, I’m afraid; but let’s find out the balance of this communication,
and then we shall know better what must be
done.”</p>

<p>“Are we to give up all hope of coming at the gold
which is described by the chart?”</p>

<p>“I think we may as well own up that it is a failure; but
we can tell after I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by a noise from the
outside, and, springing to his feet, Gil went toward the
edge of the shaft, arriving there just as a shower of missiles
descended.</p>

<p>Standing near the edge of the shaft as he did, Gil escaped
a blow; but the prisoners were hit freely, and they
set up such an outcry as caused Jenkins and Andy to
spring to their feet very suddenly.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">AN OPPORTUNE ARRIVAL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was several seconds before the mate understood what
had happened, and then, realizing that the enemy was
making an attack, he shouted as he darted into the tunnel:</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes open, boys, for it’s certain they’ll try
to take us from both sides at the same time.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you and I had better hold on here,” Gil said
to Nelse. “There’s mighty little use rushing into a place
where you can’t see a thing, and unless we look sharp the
whole crowd will be in from this end.”</p>

<p>Andy remained motionless, and for this he could not be
blamed very severely, since he had no weapons with which
to defend himself; therefore he would only be in the way
of the others in case a hand-to-hand fight ensued.</p>

<p>Stones, fragments of trees, and even earth were thrown
in from the top of the shaft, the enemy remaining concealed
from the view of those at the bottom meanwhile,
until the prisoners succeeded in making their friends understand
that no damage was being done to the white
party, and then the attack ceased at this point.</p>

<p>From the tunnel the boys could hear a medley of
sounds; but since there was no report of firearms they
rightly concluded that the danger was not sufficiently
great to warrant Jenkins in making his presence known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[245]</span></p>

<p>“What is going on in there?” Gil shouted, after five
minutes passed and the din had not subsided.</p>

<p>“The whole boilin’ of ’em have struck the trap, an’ are
flounderin’ around in great style,” the mate replied.
“Are you all right out there?”</p>

<p>“The blacks can’t do anything without inflicting the
most damage on their friends, and since understanding
that fact have been quiet. There’s nothing to fear here
for a while, so if you need one of us I’ll come.”</p>

<p>“I reckon this end of the fight is takin’ care of itself;
but we’re shut in now, an’ can count on starvin’ or surrender.”</p>

<p>Up to this moment the boys had been so interested in
the manuscript found in the so-called treasure-chamber
that they had forgotten both thirst and hunger; but now
they began to realize there was nothing in the way of
provisions, and, what was worse yet, not a drop of water
had been procured.</p>

<p>“I wish he hadn’t said anything about it,” Nelse whispered,
“for now I begin to feel as if I must have a drink.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to take it out in feeling for a while, because
it would be the height of folly to venture away from
this place until father comes.”</p>

<p>“And that may not be for a week.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be helped, unless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Unless what?” Nelse asked, eagerly, as Gil hesitated.</p>

<p>“I fancied for a minute that we might possibly make a
trade with these fellows. How would it do to tell them
they might go, if their friends would bring us water and
food?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[246]</span></p>

<p>“It isn’t probable they’d agree to it.”</p>

<p>“I reckon they are like almost everybody else, and would
do a good deal to save their own lives.”</p>

<p>“That is true, and it couldn’t do any harm to try the
scheme, although I don’t believe it will amount to anything;
but it’s only fair Jenkins should know what we intend
to do.”</p>

<p>“Go up the tunnel, and ask him what he thinks of the
plan. I’ll stay here on watch, and if he agrees we can
make Andy do the talking.”</p>

<p>Nelse ran into the passage, returning a few moments
later, as he said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Jenkins is willing we should try to make the
trade; but he don’t believe it can be done.”</p>

<p>“How are things in there?”</p>

<p>“The fellows tumbled into the hole; but there were so
many that all but two managed to get out, and the chances
are they’ll be more careful in the future.”</p>

<p>“Does Jenkins think there will be another attack?”</p>

<p>“He says they’re bound to starve us out, for it must be
known how easily that can be done.”</p>

<p>“Is he holding the two who are in the hole?”</p>

<p>“There’s no need for him to do anything, since the fellows
can’t get out, an’ we’ve got such a small number of
cartridges that it would be foolish to shoot at men who are
unable to do any mischief.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s no reason why we shouldn’t try my plan.
Here, Andy, talk to these fellows.”</p>

<p>The old darky came forward very unwillingly, and Gil
explained the offer he wanted to make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[247]</span></p>

<p>“I’se boun’ to tell ’em, honey; but it won’t do the leastest
mite ob good.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, and we’ll soon find out what they think of
it. At all events, there’ll be no great amount of harm
done.”</p>

<p>Andy did as he was bidden, and after a long conversation,
during which it seemed as if both the interpreter and
the prisoners had considerable difficulty in understanding
what was said, the blacks hailed those on the outside.</p>

<p>Then no slight amount of talking ensued, the men on
the surface keeping themselves securely hidden, and at the
close Andy was called upon once more to learn the result
of the interview.</p>

<p>“Dey say how dey ain’ got anything to do dis yere bizziness,”
the old man replied, after a painful effort to understand
the prisoners; “but some ob de gang am gone to
fin’ out ef it kin be fixed.”</p>

<p>“You won’t get any water, that I’ll guarantee,” Jenkins
said, as he emerged from the tunnel. “They have
gone to talk with the old men, an’ them fellers ain’t sich
fools as not to know it’ll only be necessary to wait twenty-four
hours before our jig is up.”</p>

<p>“Why did you leave the tunnel?” Gil asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Because there’s no use in staying there any longer.
They’ve given up tryin’ to come in by that way, an’ in a
few minutes the bosses of this ’ere fun will know jest how
we’re situated.”</p>

<p>“Then you believe I did wrong in proposing to make
the trade?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[248]</span></p>

<p>“No, I don’t. It can make mighty little difference to us
just now, an’ there was no harm to try.”</p>

<p>During the next five minutes the little party remained
in almost perfect silence, each one thinking over the situation
until all understood how futile would be their struggles
unless Captain Mansfield returned very shortly, and
then came a hail from the outside, which was answered
by one of the prisoners.</p>

<p>A short conversation ensued, and when it was ended
Andy stepped forward to act as interpreter.</p>

<p>One of the prisoners spoke at some length, and then the
old darky said, hesitatingly:</p>

<p>“Dey says ef we’se willin’ for to come out as prisoners
dey’ll gib us all we’se wants; but dere won’t be any water
sent down hyar. Ef you’se gwine ter make any bargain,
Marse Jenkins, don’ koun’ me in, kase I knows wha’ dese
fellers am boun’ ter do, ef dey gits de chance.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, Andy, we haven’t the slightest idea
of acceptin’ any such temptin’ offer. Tell that feller to
say to the others we’re goin’ to stay right where we are,
an’ some of this crowd will be sorry before the row is
ended.”</p>

<p>“Say that if any attack is made on us we shall feel
obliged to defend ourselves by shooting the prisoners,” Gil
added, hoping the threat might frighten the leaders; but
by no means intending to carry it into execution.</p>

<p>The old darky did as he was bidden, and during the
next five minutes a most exciting conversation followed
between those above and the ones below; but it finally
ceased, and Andy seated himself in the tunnel once more,<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
this time taking good care to keep well out of range, as
he said:</p>

<p>“Dat ends de tork, an’ now dey’s countin’ on windin’
dis yere bizziness up mighty quick.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what they mean to do?” Jenkins asked.</p>

<p>“Nebber a word; but one ob de rascals said dey’d hab
us outer hyar right soon.”</p>

<p>“They had better begin now, for we shall need a pile
of drivin’ before agreein’ to give ourselves up to sich
a gang,” Jenkins said, as he flourished his revolver; but
the look on his face belied the words, for he understood
only too well how soon the struggle must be ended, and
had no hope Captain Mansfield could return in time to
aid them.</p>

<p>The hour which followed was passed almost in perfect
silence. Each member of the party had bitter food for
reflection, and all knew how soon they would be overpowered
in case the enemy made a vigorous attack.</p>

<p>The one question which troubled them all was as
to which quarter the next move might be expected from,
and the boys were quite certain the blacks would confine
themselves to the tunnel, since there they could at
least enter without exposing themselves to the fire from
the revolvers.</p>

<p>“I believe they’ll do&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Gil ceased speaking very suddenly as a thin thread
of blue smoke came curling down the passage, and his
eyes involuntarily sought Jenkins’.</p>

<p>“That’s the size of it,” the mate exclaimed, as he<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
leaped to his feet. “They’ve hit on a plan that’ll do us
up in a little while without our bein’ able to stop it.”</p>

<p>“You mean they’re going to smoke us out?”</p>

<p>“Of course; can’t you see the plan has already been
begun? We shall have to stay in the shaft, an’ from
the top they’ll accomplish their work regardless of what
we may do to the prisoners.”</p>

<p>Even while Jenkins was speaking the smoke increased
in volume, and before five minutes passed all the party
were standing at the entrance of the tunnel trying to
free their eyes and lungs from the stifling vapor.</p>

<p>“There they come,” Nelse cried, and at that instant
half-a-dozen spearlike clubs were thrown, two of them
striking so near Jenkins that the sleeve of his coat was
torn into shreds.</p>

<p>Without stopping to think that they might need the
cartridges more at some future time, Gil discharged
two barrels of his revolver at random, and in reply came
more missiles, one of which knocked Andy senseless.</p>

<p>Both the boys would have sprung to his side, but that
the mate restrained them, as he said, sharply:</p>

<p>“There’s no time to attend to him; we’ve got to look
out for ourselves, an’ it’s time something&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At that instant a loud cheer, unmistakably from the
throats of white people, was heard, and Jenkins cried,
excitedly:</p>

<p>“Here comes the captain! I know that shout; but
I’m blest if I understand how he could have got here
so quick. Now we shall see the imps take to their
heels, an’ I’d like to have a chance to help them along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[251]</span></p>

<p>Before he could say anything more, Gil saw his
father’s face peering over the edge of the shaft, and
the revulsion of feeling from such a depth of despair
to that of certainty his troubles were at an end, caused
him to reel and relapse into a state of semi-unconsciousness,
which was not very far removed from a veritable
fainting spell.</p>

<p>In the shortest possible space of time the entire situation
was changed.</p>

<p>Captain Mansfield was accompanied by half-a-dozen
men, all fully armed, and they at once proceeded to help
the little party out of the shaft, Andy being the first
who was sent to the surface.</p>

<p>The old darky revived before he was fairly drawn
up, and the fact that he was no longer in any danger
caused him to forget his injuries in the joyful knowledge.</p>

<p>“How did you get here so soon?” Jenkins asked, after
the captain had welcomed the boys.</p>

<p>“We fell in with a trading schooner, and came directly
back, for somehow I had an idea that you might
be in trouble. But where are the rest of the party?”</p>

<p>Gil told in the fewest words possible of what had happened,
and showed the diamonds in proof, Jenkins adding
to the story:</p>

<p>“They’re hangin’ ’round here somewhere, an’ all I ask
is the chance to have it out with them before we leave.”</p>

<p>“You shall have the opportunity, if we fall in with
them; but I don’t propose to stay here any longer than
is absolutely necessary. After you have had something<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
to eat we’ll go on board the schooner, and read the remainder
of the story.”</p>

<p>Gil insisted on releasing the prisoners before starting
for the beach, and the poor wretches manifested the
greatest surprise at being allowed to go free when they
had fully expected to be killed. They stopped not on
the order of their going; but rushed through the tunnel
regardless of the smoke, and a few seconds later
their outcries told that they had fallen into the underground
chamber for the second time.</p>

<p>“Let them alone,” Jenkins said, with a laugh. “I’ll
guarantee they manage to get out after we leave, an’ it
won’t do ’em any harm to flounder ’round a little while.”</p>

<p>Captain Mansfield was in too much of a hurry to allow
the rescued party to linger very long near the scene of
their misadventures; but hurried them away after the
broken casket had been brought from the shaft, much to
the delight of Andy, who said, gleefully, as he clutched
firmly the mysterious “something” beneath his shirt:</p>

<p>“De cham hab done gone worked hissef out at las’ jes’
as I knowed it would; but dem debbils don’ ketch dis yere
nigger ergin, kase I’se gwine ter stick mighty clus to de
vessel arter dis.”</p>

<p>What a relief it was to find themselves in a stanch boat,
manned by a full crew, and heading for a trim-looking
schooner. It seemed to the boys as if the sky had never
been so blue, the water so sparkling, nor the air so balmy
as on this day while they were being rowed to the vessel
Captain Mansfield had chartered.</p>

<p>Then how good the water tasted. At another time they<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
might have found fault with the flavor; but now it seemed
simply delicious, and the boys devoured the hard ship’s
biscuit as if they were the lightest and sweetest of Andy’s
productions.</p>

<p>When the little party had refreshed themselves, and
were able to realize that they had really been saved from
a horrible death, Captain Mansfield said, as he took the
manuscript from the shattered casket:</p>

<p>“I will see if there is anything here which should be
attended to before we leave, and if not, the schooner shall
be gotten under way at once.”</p>

<p>“You promised to give me a chance at them thieves,”
Jenkins said, quickly.</p>

<p>“You shall have it, never fear, providing the business
can be settled before dark.”</p>

<p>Then the captain turned his attention to the manuscript,
and read, in a low tone, after glancing over that portion
which has already been given:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The stones, together with as much money as I have been able
to secrete, will remain in this subterranean chamber in case anything
should happen to me, and I have no fear the blacks will
betray the whereabouts of the hiding-place, since they are only
too eager to invest every portion of the island with mystery.</p>

<p>“Whether this story will ever be read I know not; but, in case
it is found, I implore whoever peruses it to cause search to be
made for my family. The gold and plate will be sufficient to
pay all necessary expenses, and I pray the diamonds may be given
to my wife, together with the accompanying memoranda of the
property I own in or near the capital.”</p></div>

<p>That completed the story. There was no name signed
to it, neither were there any hints as to how the members
of his family might be found; but Captain Mansfield said,<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
as he assured himself there was nothing more connected
with the unfortunate man’s history in the casket:</p>

<p>“If his wife or children are yet alive, we should be able
to trace them by giving the outlines of this story to the
different newspapers.”</p>

<p>“And we shall have no treasure after finding one,” Gil
added, mournfully.</p>

<p>“It should be sufficient to pay you for all the labor and
pain, that you will be able to relieve the wants of those
who own the jewels, providing they are in distress. It
is now quite important those sailors should be overhauled,
for they must have carried away a reasonably large
amount of gold, which must be recovered.”</p>

<p>“Shall I go ashore, sir?” Jenkins asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; but come back as soon as possible, for we want to
sail while this wind holds.”</p>

<p>Neither the boys nor Andy cared to accompany the
mate; but he had quite a large following in the crew of the
schooner, all of whom were eager to join in the search.</p>

<p>It had been expected Jenkins would be absent a long
while; but, to the surprise of all, he returned in less than
an hour, bringing two packages in baskets of grass.</p>

<p>“Did you find the men?” Gil cried, impatient to learn
the news, and not willing to wait until the boat came
alongside.</p>

<p>“We found where they had been. The screams you
heard last night while the blacks were coming through the
tunnel, were their death cries.”</p>

<p>“Have they been killed?” Nelse asked, in tones of
horror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[256]</span></p>

<p>“We discovered their bodies not a hundred yards from
the mouth of the shaft, and in the thicket near by was the
stuff they had stolen.”</p>

<p>By this time the boat was alongside, and Jenkins passed
over the rail the remainder of the treasure, consisting of
silver plate and gold coin of considerable value.</p>

<p>“Did you meet any of the blacks?” Captain Mansfield
asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir. I wanted to have one more brush with ’em;
but you spoke about bein’ in a hurry, so I thought it
wouldn’t pay.”</p>

<p>“And you did quite right. Swing the boat inboard,
boys, and we will be off.”</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later the island looked to Gil and Nelse
like nothing more than a small cloud on the surface of
the water, and the venturesome cruise was really at an
end, for before the sun rose again the schooner arrived
at a Cuban port from which a freight steamer was on
the eve of sailing for New York.</p>

<p>The journey home was decidedly uneventful after the
many stirring adventures through which Gil and Nelse
had passed, and it is well to bid them adieu as they
greet the loved ones once more.</p>

<p>To-day, if they are reading this story, imperfectly
told though it is, they will be able to verify all which
is here set down, and can add for the information of
those who may be interested, that the <em>Day Dream</em> is
afloat. Not the one which was sunk off Pearl Point;
but a new and even more speedy yacht, and she is commanded,
as may be imagined, by Job Jenkins, while the<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
captain of the galley is the same Andrew Jackson Washington
Storts, who wore the mysterious charm which
the boys were so eager to see, and which he still cherishes
as something of the utmost value and power.</p>

<p>Was the real owner of the treasure ever found?</p>

<p>Indeed she was, and never was money more needed
than by the unhappy man’s wife, who was in deepest distress
when she chanced to see the advertisements Captain
Mansfield had caused to be inserted in the daily
papers.</p>

<p>The value of the diamonds was sufficient to place her
beyond want, in a pecuniary sense, and both Gil and
Nelse are more proud of the gold watches presented by
the old lady in token of her gratitude, than they could
possibly have been, if the venturesome cruise had ended
with the discovery of the buccaneers’ treasure.</p>

<p class="center sansseriffont largefont boldfont">By ST. GEORGE RATHBORNE</p>

<p class="sansseriffont xlargefont boldfont">“Canoe and Camp-Fire”</p>

<p>In this, the first
book in the series,
the splendid setting
of the story is in the woods of Maine. A grasping uncle
waylays his nephew in the pine wilderness and endeavors to
force him to part with his birthright. A sturdy chum comes
to the rescue just in time, and joins hands in routing the thieving
relative.</p>

<p class="sansseriffont xlargefont boldfont">“Paddling Under Palmettos”</p>

<p>The boys
who play
their parts
in the second volume in this absorbing series, are manly,
whole-hearted boys, knowing no fear, whether set upon at midnight
while bivouacked around the camp-fire, or plying their
paddles in treacherous currents and menaced by unseen foes on
shore.</p>

<p class="sansseriffont xlargefont boldfont">“The Rival Canoe Boys”</p>

<p>Is the title of
the third book in
the “Camp and
Canoe Series.” It is a story of mystery, ill-fortune, and perseverance.
Two manly boys, of the lake region, are face to face
with an unscrupulous specimen of the dude type and a villainous
guide, who is open for any crime, provided there are
enough dollars back of it.</p>

<p class="sansseriffont xxlargefont boldfont r1">The Rockspur Eleven</p>

<p class="center boldfont"><em>By St. GEORGE RATHBORNE</em></p>

<p class="boldfont">There are no more delightful characters in fiction than
Karl, the young cowboy, and Cuthbert Lee, his tenderfoot
“pard,” whose strange adventures are chronicled in the
three volumes which comprise this series.</p>

<p>In “<b>Sunset Ranch</b>,” which is the first
volume in the “<span class="smcap">Ranch and Range Series</span>,”
Karl succeeds in saving from the clutches of a
villainous gang, Cuthbert’s long-lost cousin, a
laughing-eyed maid who has spent most of her
life on the prairie. Fascinating in the extreme
are the descriptions of Cowboy life as it was
in its most famous days; of the grand round-up,
range-riding, night “wrangling,” and Indian
horse racing.</p>

<p>The scene changes to a lone dug-out in the pine
woods in the second book of the Series, which is
called, “<b>Chums of the Prairie</b>.” There
is trouble for the two boys right along from the
first chapter, whether it be facing death in a
bear’s den, or brought to bay by the gray terror
of the pine.</p>

<p>Third in the “<span class="smcap">Ranch and Range Series</span>”
comes “<b>The Young Range Riders</b>,” in
which Karl and Cuthbert invade the land of the

  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i272.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-i">It is not necessary to introduce the now famous
Frank Merriwell to the American boy. His
name, associated as it is with the most marvelous
exploits and heroic deeds, has been known and
loved for years by countless youths on the
western continent. This is the first time that the Frank
Merriwell stories have appeared in cloth. The demand for
them in this form grew so clamorous that it was no longer
possible to delay publication. The edition is a handsome
one, well illustrated, type good and large, and the covers
are exceptionally fine.</p>

<p class="xlargefont boldfont r1">Frank Merriwell’s School Days</p>

<p class="il1">This is the title of the first book in the series, and surely never were
schooldays so crowded with fun and incident as those of Frank Merriwell.
Right in the beginning he risks his own life to save a girl in a battle royal
with a mad dog. But, as well as heroism, there is true sport, as any boy
will say who reads about the great baseball game in which Frank figures.</p>

<p class="xlargefont boldfont r1">Frank Merriwell’s Chums</p>

<p class="il1">In addition to the good fellows who make life pleasant for Frank Merriwell
in the period covered by No. 1 of the series, we are here introduced to
several others, who keep the ball rolling and distinguish themselves alongside
their hero.</p>

<p class="xlargefont boldfont r1">Frank Merriwell’s Foes</p>

<p class="il1">Even the best of fellows cannot help making enemies while jealousy continues
to play its part in school life. Frank is all that is manly and candid,
but there are enemies in camp, and he is frequently called upon to prove
his mettle in this the third volume in the series.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
